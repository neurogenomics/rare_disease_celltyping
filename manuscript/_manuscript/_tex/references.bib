  title    = "Regulation of islet glucagon secretion: Beyond calcium",
  author   = "Hughes, Jing W and Ustione, Alessandro and Lavagnino, Zeno and
              Piston, David W",
  abstract = "The islet of Langerhans plays a key role in glucose homeostasis
              through regulated secretion of the hormones insulin and glucagon.
              Islet research has focused on the insulin-secreting
              $\beta$-cells, even though aberrant glucagon secretion from
              $\alpha$-cells also contributes to the aetiology of diabetes.
              Despite its importance, the mechanisms controlling glucagon
              secretion remain controversial. Proper $\alpha$-cell function
              requires the islet milieu, where $\beta$- and $\delta$-cells
              drive and constrain $\alpha$-cell dynamics. The response of
              glucagon to glucose is similar between isolated islets and that
              measured in vivo, so it appears that the glucose dependence
              requires only islet-intrinsic factors and not input from blood
              flow or the nervous system. Elevated intracellular free Ca2+ is
              needed for $\alpha$-cell exocytosis, but interpreting Ca2+ data
              is tricky since it is heterogeneous among $\alpha$-cells at all
              physiological glucose levels. Total Ca2+ activity in
              $\alpha$-cells increases slightly with glucose, so Ca2+ may serve
              a permissive, rather than regulatory, role in glucagon secretion.
              On the other hand, cAMP is a more promising candidate for
              controlling glucagon secretion and is itself driven by paracrine
              signalling from $\beta$- and $\delta$-cells. Another pathway,
              juxtacrine signalling through the $\alpha$-cell EphA receptors,
              stimulated by $\beta$-cell ephrin ligands, leads to a tonic
              inhibition of glucagon secretion. We discuss potential
              combinations of Ca2+ , cAMP, paracrine and juxtacrine factors in
              the regulation of glucagon secretion, focusing on recent data in
              the literature that might unify the field towards a quantitative
              understanding of $\alpha$-cell function.",

              transcription factor, are causative of the most common type of
              X-linked deafness (X-linked deafness type 3, DFN3, DFNX2).
              POU3F4-related deafness is characterized by a typical inner ear
              malformation, namely an incomplete partition of the cochlea type
              3 (IP3), with or without an enlargement of the vestibular
              aqueduct (EVA). The pathomechanism underlying POU3F4-related
              deafness and the corresponding transcriptional targets are
              largely uncharacterized. Two male patients belonging to a
              Caucasian cohort with HL and EVA who presented with an IP3 were
              submitted to genetic analysis. Two novel sequence variants in
              POU3F4 were identified by Sanger sequencing. In cell-based
              assays, the corresponding protein variants (p.S74Afs*8 and
              p.C327*) showed an aberrant expression and subcellular

              a novel transcriptional target of POU3F4 by RNA sequencing and

              downregulation of SLC6A20 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

              in vitro MDSC generation assay we demonstrate that low

              to an induction of functional MDSC, whereas increased
              concentrations, conversely, reduced MDSC numbers. The
              concentration-dependent reduction of MDSC correlated with T cell
              proliferation and cytotoxicity. Several findings supported a role
              for staphylococcal enterotoxins in modulating MDSC generation.

              cytotoxicity, while an enterotoxin-deficient S. aureus strain

              staphylococcal enterotoxins as main modulators of MDSC

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Incomplete partition type 3 (IP3) malformation
              deafness is a rare hereditary cause of congenital or rapid
              progressive hearing loss. The children present with a severe to
              profound mixed hearing loss and temporal bone imaging show a
              typical inner ear malformation classified as IP3. Cochlear
              implantation is one option of hearing restoration in severe
              cases. Little is known about other specific difficulties these
              children might exhibit, for instance possible neurodevelopmental
              symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten 2; 0 to 9; 6-year-old
              children with IP3 malformation deafness (nine boys and one girl)
              with cochlear implants were evaluated with a retrospective chart
              review in combination with an additional extensive
              multidisciplinary assessment day. Hearing, language, cognition,
              and mental ill-health were compared with a control group of ten
              1; 6 to 14; 5-year-old children with cochlear implants (seven
              boys and three girls) with another genetic cause of deafness,
              mutations in the GJB2 gene. RESULTS: Mutations in POU3F4 were
              found in nine of the 10 children with IP3 malformation. Children
              with IP3 malformation deafness had an atypical outcome with low
              level of speech recognition (especially in noise), executive
              functioning deficits, delayed or impaired speech as well as
              atypical lexical-semantic and pragmatic abilities, and exhibited
              mental ill-health issues. Parents of children with IP3
              malformation were more likely to report that they were worried
              about their child's psychosocial wellbeing. Controls, however,
              had more age-typical results in all these domains. Eight of 10
              children in the experimental group had high nonverbal cognitive
              ability despite their broad range of neurodevelopmental symptoms.
              CONCLUSIONS: While cochlear implantation is a feasible
              alternative for children with IP3 malformation deafness,
              co-occurring neurodevelopmental anomalies, such as attention
              deficit hyperactivity or developmental language disorder, and
              mental ill-health issues require an extensive and consistent
              multidisciplinary team approach during childhood to support their

              progressive, monogenic motor neuron disease with an onset during
              infancy that results in failure to achieve motor milestones and
              in death or the need for mechanical ventilation by 2 years of
              age. We studied functional replacement of the mutated gene
              encoding survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) in this disease. METHODS:
              Fifteen patients with SMA1 received a single dose of intravenous
              adeno-associated virus serotype 9 carrying SMN complementary DNA
              encoding the missing SMN protein. Three of the patients received
              a low dose (6.7$\times$1013 vg per kilogram of body weight), and
              12 received a high dose (2.0$\times$1014 vg per kilogram). The
              primary outcome was safety. The secondary outcome was the time
              until death or the need for permanent ventilatory assistance. In
              exploratory analyses, we compared scores on the CHOP INTEND
              (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular
              Disorders) scale of motor function (ranging from 0 to 64, with
              higher scores indicating better function) in the two cohorts and
              motor milestones in the high-dose cohort with scores in studies
              of the natural history of the disease (historical cohorts).
              RESULTS: As of the data cutoff on August 7, 2017, all 15 patients
              were alive and event-free at 20 months of age, as compared with a
              rate of survival of 8\% in a historical cohort. In the high-dose
              cohort, a rapid increase from baseline in the score on the CHOP
              INTEND scale followed gene delivery, with an increase of 9.8
              points at 1 month and 15.4 points at 3 months, as compared with a
              decline in this score in a historical cohort. Of the 12 patients
              who had received the high dose, 11 sat unassisted, 9 rolled over,
              11 fed orally and could speak, and 2 walked independently.
              Elevated serum aminotransferase levels occurred in 4 patients and
              were attenuated by prednisolone. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with
              SMA1, a single intravenous infusion of adeno-associated viral
              vector containing DNA coding for SMN resulted in longer survival,
              superior achievement of motor milestones, and better motor
              function than in historical cohorts. Further studies are
              necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of this gene
              therapy. (Funded by AveXis and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number,

              the vast quantities of data arising from biological experiments.
              While this works well when using a single ontology, integrating
              multiple ontologies can be problematic, as they are developed
              independently, which can lead to incompatibilities. The Open
              Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry was created to
              address this by facilitating the development, harmonization,
              application and sharing of ontologies, guided by a set of
              overarching principles. One challenge in reaching these goals was
              that the OBO principles were not originally encoded in a precise
              fashion, and interpretation was subjective. Here, we show how we
              have addressed this by formally encoding the OBO principles as
              operational rules and implementing a suite of automated
              validation checks and a dashboard for objectively evaluating each
              ontology's compliance with each principle. This entailed a
              substantial effort to curate metadata across all ontologies and
              to coordinate with individual stakeholders. We have applied these
              checks across the full OBO suite of ontologies, revealing areas
              where individual ontologies require changes to conform to our
              principles. Our work demonstrates how a sizable, federated

              since the 1960s has enabled gene therapy to become a real

              After several ups and downs in the gene therapy field, we are

              several ex vivo and in vivo gene therapies have reached maturity.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The Cell Ontology (CL) is an OBO Foundry candidate
              ontology covering the domain of canonical, natural biological
              cell types. Since its inception in 2005, the CL has undergone
              multiple rounds of revision and expansion, most notably in its
              representation of hematopoietic cells. For in vivo cells, the CL
              focuses on vertebrates but provides general classes that can be
              used for other metazoans, which can be subtyped in
              species-specific ontologies. CONSTRUCTION AND CONTENT: Recent
              work on the CL has focused on extending the representation of
              various cell types, and developing new modules in the CL itself,
              and in related ontologies in coordination with the CL. For
              example, the Kidney and Urinary Pathway Ontology was used as a
              template to populate the CL with additional cell types. In
              addition, subtypes of the class 'cell in vitro' have received
              improved definitions and labels to provide for modularity with
              the representation of cells in the Cell Line Ontology and Reagent
              Ontology. Recent changes in the ontology development methodology
              for CL include a switch from OBO to OWL for the primary encoding
              of the ontology, and an increasing reliance on logical
              definitions for improved reasoning. UTILITY AND DISCUSSION: The
              CL is now mandated as a metadata standard for large functional
              genomics and transcriptomics projects, and is used extensively
              for annotation, querying, and analyses of cell type specific data
              in sequencing consortia such as FANTOM5 and ENCODE, as well as
              for the NIAID ImmPort database and the Cell Image Library. The CL
              is also a vital component used in the modular construction of
              other biomedical ontologies-for example, the Gene Ontology and
              the cross-species anatomy ontology, Uberon, use CL to support the
              consistent representation of cell types across different levels
              of anatomical granularity, such as tissues and organs.
              CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing improvements to the CL make it a
              valuable resource to both the OBO Foundry community and the wider
              scientific community, and we continue to experience increased
              interest in the CL both among developers and within the user

              understanding and underlying evidence for these diseases have
              expanded over time, existing practices to generate knowledge from
              these publications and resources have not been able to keep pace.
              Through determining the applicability of computational approaches
              to enhance or replace manual curation tasks, we aim to both
              improve the sustainability and relevance of consumer health

              which translational science researchers may start to unravel
              disease characteristics that are vital to the research process.
              RESULTS: We developed a meta-ontology based integrative knowledge
              graph for rare diseases in Neo4j. This integrative knowledge
              graph includes a total of 3,819,623 nodes and 84,223,681
              relations from 34 different biomedical data resources, including
              curated drug and rare disease associations. Semi-automatic
              mappings were generated for 2154 unique FDA orphan designations

              indication from Inxight Drugs, which were integrated into the

              the capabilities of this integrative knowledge graph in
              accelerating the curation of scientific understanding on rare
              diseases through the generation of disease mappings/profiles and

              well-established database resources, we developed an integrative
              knowledge graph containing a large volume of biomedical and
              research data. Demonstration of several immediate use cases and

  abstract = "Genetic and molecular analysis of rare disease is made difficult
              by the small numbers of affected patients. Phenotypic comorbidity
              analysis can help rectify this by combining information from
              individuals with similar phenotypes and looking for overlap in
              terms of shared genes and underlying functional systems. However,
              few studies have combined comorbidity analysis with genomic data.
              We present a computational approach that connects patient
              phenotypes based on phenotypic co-occurence and uses genomic
              information related to the patient mutations to assign genes to
              the phenotypes, which are used to detect enriched functional
              systems. These phenotypes are clustered using network analysis to
              obtain functionally coherent phenotype clusters. We applied the
              approach to the DECIPHER database, containing phenotypic and
              genomic information for thousands of patients with heterogeneous
              rare disorders and copy number variants. Validity was
              demonstrated through overlap with known diseases, co-mention
              within the biomedical literature, semantic similarity measures,
              and patient cluster membership. These connected pairs formed
              multiple phenotype clusters, showing functional coherence, and
              mapped to genes and systems involved in similar pathological
              processes. Examples include claudin genes from the 22q11 genomic
              region associated with a cluster of phenotypes related to
              DiGeorge syndrome and genes related to the GO term
              anterior/posterior pattern specification associated with abnormal
              development. The clusters generated can help with the diagnosis
              of rare diseases, by suggesting additional phenotypes for a given
              patient and potential underlying functional systems. Other tools
              to find causal genes based on phenotype were also investigated.
              The approach has been implemented as a workflow, named PhenCo,
              which can be adapted to any set of patients for which phenomic
              and genomic data is available. Full details of the analysis,
              including the clusters formed, their constituent functional

              inhibitors of T cell activation. A role for MDSCs in bacterial
              infections has only recently emerged, and nothing is known about
              MDSC function in the context of Staphylococcus aureus infection.
              Because S. aureus biofilms are capable of subverting
              immune-mediated clearance, we examined whether MDSCs could play a
              role in this process. CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) MDSCs represented the main
              cellular infiltrate during S. aureus orthopedic biofilm
              infection, accounting for >75\% of the CD45+ population.
              Biofilm-associated MDSCs inhibited T cell proliferation and
              cytokine production, which correlated with a paucity of T cell
              infiltrates at the infection site. Analysis of FACS-purified
              MDSCs recovered from S. aureus biofilms revealed increased
              arginase-1, inducible NO synthase, and IL-10 expression, key
              mediators of MDSC suppressive activity. Targeted depletion of
              MDSCs and neutrophils using the mAb 1A8 (anti-Ly6G) improved
              bacterial clearance by enhancing the intrinsic proinflammatory
              attributes of infiltrating monocytes and macrophages.
              Furthermore, the ability of monocytes/macrophages to promote
              biofilm clearance in the absence of MDSC action was revealed with
              RB6-C85 (anti-Gr-1 or anti-Ly6G/Ly6C) administration, which
              resulted in significantly increased S. aureus burdens both
              locally and in the periphery, because effector Ly 6C monocytes
              and, by extension, mature macrophages were also depleted.
              Collectively, these results demonstrate that MDSCs are key
              contributors to the chronicity of S. aureus biofilm infection, as
              their immunosuppressive function prevents monocyte/macrophage
              proinflammatory activity, which facilitates biofilm persistence.",

               that has been increasing in prevalence over the last decades.
               Historically, 46, XY patients with severe hypospadias and
               descended scrotal testes at birth have frequently lacked a
               genetic diagnosis. Platforms for molecular genetic testing have
               become more readily available and can offer an insight into
               underlying genetic causes of severe hypospadias. The goal of
               this study was to define the anatomical characteristics of
               severe hypospadias that can accurately define patients with 46,
               XY severe hypospadias and determine the practical utility of
               performing molecular genetic testing in this group of
               patients.MethodsPatients who met the criteria for 46, XY severe
               hypospadias were offered a molecular genetic work-up in
               consultation with pediatric genetics. Patients were identified
               through chart review. Data extracted included karyotype,
               hypospadias phenotype including stretched penile length at
               diagnosis, age at genetic diagnosis, molecular genetic testing,
               pathogenic gene variant(s), gender identity, and clinical
               course. All patients underwent clinical genetic testing via 46,
               XY Disorders of Sexual Development (DSD) panels offered by
               Invitae\textregistered{}, GeneDx\textregistered{}, or Blueprint
               Genetics\textregistered{}.ResultsOf the 14 patients that
               underwent genetic testing, there were 5 previously published and
               3 novel pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in genes
               associated with 46, XY severe hypospadias (Table). Pathogenic
               variants were identified in AR (3), SRD5A2 [1], NR5A1 [2], WT1
               [1], and ARTX [1]. Two patients had a variant of unknown
               significance, one in FREM2 and another in CEP41. Four had
               negative gene panels. The patient with the WT1 pathogenic
               variant was subsequently found to have developed a Wilms tumor
               and the patients with NR5A1 pathogenic variants are now
               undergoing adrenal insufficiency

               hypospadias and descended testes in the scrotum at birth can
               benefit from molecular genetic testing as their underlying

              building evidence toward causality of novel disease genes in
              patients with undiagnosed rare diseases. The Matchmaker Exchange
              (MME) is a collaborative initiative that facilitates
              international data sharing for matchmaking purposes; however,
              data on user experience is limited. METHODS: Patients enrolled as
              part of the Finding of Rare Disease Genes in Canada (FORGE) and
              Care4Rare Canada research programs had their exome sequencing
              data reanalyzed by a multidisciplinary research team over a
              2-year period. Compelling variants in genes not previously
              associated with a human phenotype were submitted through the MME
              node PhenomeCentral, and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: In
              this study, 194 novel candidate genes were submitted to the MME,
              resulting in 1514 matches, and 15\% of the genes submitted
              resulted in collaborations. Most submissions resulted in at least
              1 match, and most matches were with GeneMatcher (82\%), where
              additional email exchange was required to evaluate the match
              because of the lack of phenotypic or inheritance information.
              CONCLUSION: Matchmaking through the MME is an effective way to
              investigate novel candidate genes; however, it is a
              labor-intensive process. Engagement from the community to
              contribute phenotypic, genotypic, and inheritance data will

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AIMS: Drug prices are regarded as one of the most
              influential factors in determining accessibility and
              affordability to novel therapies. Cell and gene therapies such as
              OTL-200 (brand name: Libmeldy) and AVXS-101 (brand name:
              Zolgensma) with (expected) list prices of 3.0 million EUR and 1.9
              million EUR per treatment, respectively, spark a global debate on
              the affordability of such therapies. The aim of this study was to
              use a recently published cost-based pricing model to calculate
              prices for cell and gene therapies, with OTL-200 and AVXS-101 as
              case study examples. METHODS: Using the pricing model proposed by
              Uyl-de Groot and L{\"o}wenberg, we estimated a price for both
              therapies. We searched the literature and online public sources
              to estimate (i) research and development (R\&D) expenses adjusted
              for risk of failure and cost of capital, (ii) the eligible
              patient population and (iii) costs of drug manufacturing to
              calculate a base-case price for OTL-200 and AVXS-101. All model
              input parameters were varied in a stepwise, deterministic
              sensitivity analysis and scenario analyses to assess their impact
              on the calculated prices. RESULTS: Prices for OTL-200 and
              AVXS-101 were estimated at 1 048 138 EUR and 380 444 EUR per
              treatment, respectively. In deterministic sensitivity analyses,
              varying R\&D estimates had the greatest impact on the price for
              OTL-200, whereas for AVXS-101, changes in the profit margin
              changed the calculated price substantially. Highest prices in
              scenario analyses were achieved when assuming the lowest number
              of patients for OTL-200 and highest R\&D expenses for AVXS-101.
              The lowest R\&D expenses scenario resulted in lowest prices for
              either therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that, using the
              proposed model, prices for both OTL-200 and AVXS-101 lie
              substantially below the currently (proposed) list prices for both
              therapies. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of the used model input
              parameters is considerable, which translates in a wide range of
              estimated prices. This is mainly because of a lack of
              transparency from pharmaceutical companies regarding R\&D
              expenses and the costs of drug manufacturing. Simultaneously, the
              disease indications for both therapies remain heavily
              understudied in terms of their epidemiological profile. Despite
              the considerable variation in the estimated prices, our results
              may support the public debate on value-based and cost-based
              pricing models, and on ``fair'' drug prices in general.",

              placenta is a unique terminally differentiated, multi-nucleated
              syncytium. No mitotic bodies are observed in the STB, which is
              sustained by continuous fusion of underlying cytotrophoblast
              cells (CTB). As a result, STB nuclei are of different ages.
              Morphologically, they display varying degrees of chromatin
              compaction, suggesting progressive maturational changes. Until
              recently, it was thought that STB nuclei were transcriptionally
              inactive, with all the mRNAs required by the syncytium being
              incorporated upon fusion of CTB. However, recent research has
              shown the presence of the active form of RNA polymerase II (RNA
              Pol II) in some STB nuclei. In this study, we confirm the
              presence of transcriptional activity in STB nuclei by
              demonstrating immunoreactivity for a transcription factor and an
              RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) co-factor, phospho-cAMP response
              element-binding protein and phospho-upstream binding factor,
              respectively. We also show, through immunoco-localisation
              studies, that a proportion of STB nuclei are both RNA Pol I and
              II transcriptionally active. Finally, we quantify the numerical
              densities of nuclei immunopositive and immunonegative for RNA Pol
              II in the STB of normal placentas of 11-39 weeks gestational age
              using an unbiased stereological counting tool, the physical
              disector. These data were combined with estimates of the volume
              of trophoblast to calculate total numbers of both types of nuclei
              at each gestational age. We found no correlation between
              gestational age and the numerical density of RNA Pol II-positive
              nuclei in the villous trophoblast (r = 0.39, P > 0.05). As the
              number of STB nuclei increases exponentially during gestation, we
              conclude that the number of transcriptionally active nuclei
              increases in proportion to trophoblast volume. The ratio of
              active to inactive nuclei remains constant at 3.9:1. These
              findings confirm that the majority of STB nuclei have intrinsic
              transcriptional activity, and that the STB is not dependent on
              CTB fusion for the provision of transcripts.",

              Mutations in two genes, CCNO and MCIDAS, have been identified as
              a cause of this disease, both leading to a greatly reduced number
              of cilia and causing impaired mucociliary clearance. This study
              was designed to identify the prevalence of CCNO mutations in
              Israel and further delineate the clinical characteristics of
              RGMC. We analyzed 170 families with mucociliary clearance
              disorders originating from Israel for mutations in CCNO and
              identified two novel mutations (c.165delC, p.Gly56Alafs*38;

              mutation (c.638T>C, p.Leu213Pro) was demonstrated by functional
              analyses in Xenopus. Combining these 15 patients with the

              hydrocephalus (10\%) as well as increased female infertility

              disease (IMD) in England over the last decade. METHODS: Public
              Health England conducts enhanced surveillance of IMD in England.
              We retrospectively identified patients with complement deficiency
              who developed IMD in England during 2008-2017 and retrieved
              information on their clinical presentation, vaccination status,
              medication history, recurrence of infection and outcomes, as well
              as characteristics of the infecting meningococcal strain.
              RESULTS: A total of 16 patients with 20 IMD episodes were
              identified, including four with two episodes. Six patients had
              inherited complement deficiencies, two had immune-mediated
              conditions associated with complement deficiency
              (glomerulonephritis and vasculitis), and eight others were on
              Eculizumab therapy, five for paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria
              and three for atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Cultures were
              available for 7 of 11 episodes among those with inherited
              complement deficiencies/immune-mediated conditions and the
              predominant capsular group was Y (7/11), followed by B (3/11) and
              non-groupable (1/11) strains. Among patients receiving Eculizumab
              therapy, 3 of the 9 episodes were due to group B (3/9), three
              others were NG but genotypically group B, and one case each of
              groups E, W and Y. CONCLUSIONS: In England, complement deficiency
              is rare among IMD cases and includes inherited disorders of the
              late complement pathway, immune-mediated disorders associated
              with low complement levels and patients on Eculizumab therapy.
              IMD due to capsular group Y predominates in patient with
              inherited complement deficiency, whilst those on Eculizumab

              known about how such mutations affect normal functions of the
              POU3F4 protein and cause inner ear malformations and deafness.
              Here we describe three novel mutations of the POU3F4 gene and
              their clinical characterizations in three Korean families
              carrying deafness segregating at the DFN3 locus. The three
              mutations cause a substitution (p.Arg329Pro) or a deletion
              (p.Ser310del) of highly conserved amino acid residues in the POU
              homeodomain or a truncation that eliminates both DNA-binding
              domains (p.Ala116fs). In an attempt to better understand the
              molecular mechanisms underlying their inner ear defects, we
              examined the behavior of the normal and mutant forms of the
              POU3F4 protein in C3H/10T1/2 mesodermal cells. Protein modeling
              as well as in vitro assays demonstrated that these mutations are
              detrimental to the tertiary structure of the POU3F4 protein and
              severely affect its ability to bind DNA. All three mutated POU3F4
              proteins failed to transactivate expression of a reporter gene.
              In addition, all three failed to inhibit the transcriptional
              activity of wild-type proteins when both wild-type and mutant
              proteins were coexpressed. Since most of the mutations reported
              for DFN3 thus far are associated with regions that encode the DNA
              binding domains of POU3F4, our results strongly suggest that the
              deafness in DFN3 patients is largely due to the null function of

              to the conclusion that maturation arrest of liver-determined
              tissue stem cells was the cellular process that gives rise to
              hepatocellular carcinomas. When the cellular changes in these
              processes were compared to that of the formation of
              teratocarcinomas, the hypothesis arose that all cancers arise
              from maturation arrest of tissue-determined stem cells. This was
              essentially a reinterpretation of the embryonal rest theory of
              cancer whereby tissue stem cells take the role of embryonal
              rests. A corollary of the stem cell theory of the origin of
              cancer is that cancers contain the same functional cell
              populations as normal tissues: stem cells, transit-amplifying
              cells and mature cells. Cancer stem cells retain the essential
              feature of normal stem cells: the ability to self-renew. Growth
              of cancers is due to continued proliferation of cancer
              transit-amplifying cells that do not differentiate to mature
              cells (maturation arrest). On the other hand, cancer stem cells
              generally divide very rarely and contribute little to tumor
              growth. However, the presence of cancer stem cells in tumors is
              believed to be responsible for the properties of immortalization,
              transplantability and resistance to therapy characteristic of
              cancers. Current therapies for cancer (chemotherapy,
              radiotherapy, antiangiogenesis and differentiation therapy) are
              directed against the cancer transit-amplifying cells. When these
              therapies are discontinued, the cancer reforms from the cancer
              stem cells. Therapy directed toward interruption of the cell
              signaling pathways that maintain cancer stem cells could lead to
              new modalities to the prevention of regrowth of the cancer.",

  abstract = "Cancer treatments always face challenging problems, particularly
              drug resistance due to tumor cell heterogeneity. The existing
              datasets include the relationship between gene expression and
              drug sensitivities; however, the majority are based on
              tissue-level studies. Study drugs at the single-cell level are
              perspective to overcome minimal residual disease caused by
              subclonal resistant cancer cells retained after initial curative
              therapy. Fortunately, machine learning techniques can help us
              understand how different types of cells respond to different
              cancer drugs from the perspective of single-cell gene expression.
              Good modeling using single-cell data and drug response
              information will not only improve machine learning for cell-drug
              outcome prediction but also facilitate the discovery of drugs for
              specific cancer subgroups and specific cancer treatments. In this
              paper, we review machine learning and deep learning approaches in
              drug research. By analyzing the application of these methods on
              cancer cell lines and single-cell data and comparing the
              technical gap between single-cell sequencing data analysis and
              single-cell drug sensitivity analysis, we hope to explore the
              trends and potential of drug research at the single-cell data
              level and provide more inspiration for drug research at the
              single-cell level. We anticipate that this review will stimulate

              would otherwise progress to complete blindness. METHODS: In this
              open-label, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial done at two
              sites in the USA, individuals aged 3 years or older with, in each
              eye, best corrected visual acuity of 20/60 or worse, or visual
              field less than 20 degrees in any meridian, or both, with
              confirmed genetic diagnosis of biallelic RPE65 mutations,
              sufficient viable retina, and ability to perform standardised
              multi-luminance mobility testing (MLMT) within the luminance
              range evaluated, were eligible. Participants were randomly
              assigned (2:1) to intervention or control using a permuted block
              design, stratified by age (<10 years and $\geq$10 years) and
              baseline mobility testing passing level (pass at $\geq$125 lux vs
              <125 lux). Graders assessing primary outcome were masked to
              treatment group. Intervention was bilateral, subretinal injection
              of 1·5 $\times$ 1011 vector genomes of voretigene neparvovec in
              0·3 mL total volume. The primary efficacy endpoint was 1-year
              change in MLMT performance, measuring functional vision at
              specified light levels. The intention-to-treat (ITT) and modified
              ITT populations were included in primary and safety analyses.
              This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
              NCT00999609, and enrolment is complete. FINDINGS: Between Nov 15,
              2012, and Nov 21, 2013, 31 individuals were enrolled and randomly
              assigned to intervention (n=21) or control (n=10). One
              participant from each group withdrew after consent, before
              intervention, leaving an mITT population of 20 intervention and
              nine control participants. At 1 year, mean bilateral MLMT change
              score was 1·8 (SD 1·1) light levels in the intervention group
              versus 0·2 (1·0) in the control group (difference of 1·6, 95\% CI
              0·72-2·41, p=0·0013). 13 (65\%) of 20 intervention participants,
              but no control participants, passed MLMT at the lowest luminance
              level tested (1 lux), demonstrating maximum possible improvement.
              No product-related serious adverse events or deleterious immune
              responses occurred. Two intervention participants, one with a
              pre-existing complex seizure disorder and another who experienced
              oral surgery complications, had serious adverse events unrelated
              to study participation. Most ocular events were mild in severity.

  abstract = "Hypospadias, a midline fusion defect of the male ventral urethra,
              is a relatively common genital anomaly occurring in 0.3 - 7 of
              1000 live male births. The anatomical location of the misplaced
              urethral meatus determines the severity of this anomaly with the
              severity increasing from distal to proximal. Glandular and penile
              hypospadias, the most common forms, often appear as an isolated
              anomaly and account for the majority of hypospadias, whereas
              about 20 \% are classified as scrotal and perineal types. These
              latter forms frequently occur in association with other genital
              anomalies such as microphallus, bifid scrotum, penoscrotal
              transposition, and cryptorchidism, and may represent an intersex
              phenotype. Besides a higher incidence in consanguineous families
              and a suggested recessive inheritance, in other families a
              dominant transmission is likely. The recurrence risk in the next
              generation seems to be correlated with the severity of
              hypospadias. Only 30 \% of severe hypospadias can be attributed
              to defects in the synthesis of testosterone or adrenal steroid
              hormones, receptor defects, syndrome-associated hypospadias,
              chromosomal anomalies, defects in other genetic factors, or
              exogenous forms. To identify the underlying causes of the
              remaining 70 \% ``idiopathic'' hypospadias, familial and twin
              studies were performed. Familial studies can help identify gene
              loci and, subsequently, candidate genes by mutational analysis.

              proteomics can help detect gene expression or protein
              differences. Furthermore, genetically modified animal models can
              be used to detect phylogenetically homologous genes in man. In

              one or a few genes according to clinical features; this approach
              is changing as improved sequencing methods enable simultaneous
              analysis of several genes. Neonatal diabetes is the presenting
              feature of many discrete clinical phenotypes defined by different
              genetic causes. Genetic subtype defines treatment, with improved
              glycaemic control on sulfonylurea treatment for most patients
              with potassium channel mutations. We investigated the effect of
              early, comprehensive testing of all known genetic causes of
              neonatal diabetes. METHODS: In this large, international, cohort
              study, we studied patients with neonatal diabetes diagnosed with
              diabetes before 6 months of age who were referred from 79
              countries. We identified mutations by comprehensive genetic
              testing including Sanger sequencing, 6q24 methylation analysis,
              and targeted next-generation sequencing of all known neonatal
              diabetes genes. FINDINGS: Between January, 2000, and August,
              2013, genetic testing was done in 1020 patients (571 boys, 449
              girls). Mutations in the potassium channel genes were the most
              common cause (n=390) of neonatal diabetes, but were identified
              less frequently in consanguineous families (12\% in
              consanguineous families vs 46\% in non-consanguineous families;
              p4 years; p<0·0001), in whom skeletal and liver involvement was
              common. Similarly, for patients with genetically diagnosed
              transient neonatal diabetes, the diabetes had remitted in only
              ten (10\%) of 101 patients tested early (<3 months) compared with
              60 (100\%) of the 60 later referrals (p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION:
              Patients are now referred for genetic testing closer to their
              presentation with neonatal diabetes. Comprehensive testing of all
              causes identified causal mutations in more than 80\% of cases.
              The genetic result predicts the best diabetes treatment and
              development of related features. This model represents a new
              framework for clinical care with genetic diagnosis preceding
              development of clinical features and guiding clinical management.

              remains the sheer number of datasets and inconsistent format,
              data models and accessibility. Many datasets are available via
              unique portals platforms that often lack interoperability. Here,
              we present CZ CellxGene Discover ( cellxgene.cziscience.com), a

              single-cell data resource, available via a free-to-use online
              data portal, hosts a growing corpus of community contributed data
              that spans more than 50 million unique cells. Curated,
              standardized, and associated with consistent cell-level metadata,
              this collection of interoperable single-cell transcriptomic data
              is the largest of its kind. A suite of tools and features enables
              accessibility and reusability of the data via both computational
              and visual interfaces to allow researchers to rapidly explore
              individual datasets and perform cross-corpus analysis. This

              (TPD) are susceptible to recurrent invasive meningococcal disease
              (IMD). Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) strains infecting these
              patients are poorly documented in the literature. Methods: We
              identified patients with TPD and available Nm strains isolated
              during IMD. We investigated the genetic basis of the different
              TPDs and the characteristics of the Nm strains. Results: We
              included 56 patients with C5 (n = 8), C6 (n = 20), C7 (n = 18),
              C8 (n = 9), or C9 (n = 1) deficiency. Genetic study was performed
              in 47 patients and 30 pathogenic variants were identified in the
              genes coding for C5 (n = 4), C6 (n = 5), C7 (n = 12), C8 (n = 7),
              and C9 (n = 2). We characterized 61 Nm strains responsible for
              IMD in the 56 patients with TPD. The most frequent strains
              belonged to groups Y (n = 27 [44\%]), B (n = 18 [30\%]), and W (n
              = 8 [13\%]). Hyperinvasive clonal complexes (CC11, CC32, CC41/44,
              and CC269) were responsible for 21\% of IMD cases. The CC23
              predominates and represented 26\% of all invasive isolates.
              Eleven of the 15 clonal complexes identified fit to 12 different
              clonal complexes belonging to carriage strains. Conclusions:
              Unusual meningococcal strains with low level of virulence similar

              diseases remain largely unknown. One route to understanding the
              primary pathological cell type for a particular disease is to
              identify the cells expressing susceptibility genes. Although this
              is straightforward for monogenic conditions where the causative
              mutation may alter expression of a cell type specific marker,
              methods are required for the common polygenic disorders. We
              developed the Expression Weighted Cell Type Enrichment (EWCE)
              method that uses single cell transcriptomes to generate the
              probability distribution associated with a gene list having an
              average level of expression within a cell type. Following
              validation, we applied EWCE to human genetic data from cases of
              epilepsy, Schizophrenia, Autism, Intellectual Disability,
              Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis and anxiety disorders.
              Genetic susceptibility primarily affected microglia in
              Alzheimer's and Multiple Sclerosis; was shared between
              interneurons and pyramidal neurons in Autism and Schizophrenia;
              while intellectual disabilities and epilepsy were attributable to
              a range of cell-types, with the strongest enrichment in
              interneurons. We hypothesized that the primary cell type
              pathology could trigger secondary changes in other cell types and
              these could be detected by applying EWCE to transcriptome data
              from diseased tissue. In Autism, Schizophrenia and Alzheimer's
              disease we find evidence of pathological changes in all of the
              major brain cell types. These findings give novel insight into
              the cellular origins and progression in common brain disorders.
              The methods can be applied to any tissue and disorder and have

              factor for cognitive decline. The objective of this systematic
              review is to synthesise the published literature on the
              association of VI with cognitive decline, cognitive impairment or
              dementia, to aid the development of interventions and guide
              public policies pertaining to the relationship between vision and
              cognition. METHODS: A literature search was performed with
              Embase, Medline and Cochrane library databases from inception to
              March 2020, and included abstracts and articles published in
              peer-reviewed journals in English. Our inclusion criteria
              included publications that contained subjective/objective
              measures of vision and cognition, or a diagnosis of VI, cognitive
              impairment or dementia. Longitudinal or cross-sectional studies
              with $\geq$100 participants aged >50 years were included. The
              search identified 11 805 articles whose abstracts underwent
              screening by three teams of study authors. Data abstraction and
              quality assessment using the Effective Public Health Practice
              Project Quality Assessment Tool were performed by one author
              (NN). 10\% of the articles underwent abstraction and appraisal by
              a second author (LA/VV), results were compared between both and
              were in agreement. RESULTS: 110 full-text articles were selected
              for data extraction, of which 53 were cross-sectional, 43
              longitudinal and 14 were case-control studies. The mean age of
              participants was 73.0 years (range 50-93.1). Ninety-one (83\%) of
              these studies reported that VI was associated with cognitive
              impairment. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review indicates that a
              majority of studies examining the vision-cognition relationship
              report that VI is associated with more cognitive decline,
              cognitive impairment or dementia among older adults. This
              synthesis supports the need for additional research to understand
              the mechanisms underlying the association between VI and

              this study, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for the
              suppression of T cell responses during chronic S. aureus
              infection. Using in vitro coculture systems, as well as in vivo
              adoptive transfer of CFSE-labeled OT-II cells, we demonstrated
              the presence of immunosuppressive mechanisms in splenocytes of S.
              aureus-infected mice that inhibited the response of OT-II cells
              to cognate antigenic stimulation. Immunosuppression was
              IL-10/TGF-$\beta$ independent but required cell-cell proximity.
              Using DEREG and Foxp3(gfp) mice, we demonstrated that
              CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells contributed, but only to
              a minor degree, to bystander immunosuppression. Neither
              regulatory B cells nor tolerogenic dendritic cells contributed to
              immunosuppression. Instead, we found a significant expansion of
              granulocytic (CD11b(+)Ly6G(+)Ly6C(low)) and monocytic
              (CD11b(+)Ly6G(-)Ly6C(high)) myeloid-derived suppressor cells
              (MDSC) in chronically infected mice, which exerted a strong
              immunosuppressive effect on T cell responses. Splenocytes of S.
              aureus-infected mice lost most of their suppressive activity
              after the in vivo depletion of MDSC by treatment with
              gemcitabine. Furthermore, a robust negative correlation was
              observed between the degree of T cell inhibition and the number
              of MDSC. An increase in the numbers of MDSC in S. aureus-infected
              mice by adoptive transfer caused a significant exacerbation of
              infection. In summary, our results indicate that expansion of
              MDSC and, to a minor degree, of regulatory T cells in S.
              aureus-infected mice may create an immunosuppressive environment
              that sustains chronic infection.",

              forming the cytotrophoblastic shell, the early placenta. The
              cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) are the so-called epithelial 'stem cells'
              of the placenta, which, depending on the signals they receive,
              can differentiate into either extravillous trophoblast (EVT) or
              syncytiotrophoblast (STB). EVTs anchor the placenta to the
              uterine wall and remodel maternal spiral arterioles in order to
              provide ample blood supply to the growing fetus. STBs arise
              through CTB fusion, secrete hormones necessary for pregnancy
              maintenance and form a barrier across which nutrient and gas

              during the first trimester, before the onset of maternal arterial
              blood flow into the intervillous space of the placenta, and thus

              or more doctors to get a diagnosis and 45.9\% had received at
              least one incorrect diagnosis. Almost three quarters (72.1\%)
              received no or not enough information at the time of diagnosis.
              In the 12 months prior to the survey, over 80\% of respondents
              had used the services of a general practitioner and a medical
              specialist while around a third had been inpatients at a hospital
              or had visited an emergency department. Only 15.4\% of
              respondents had ever used paediatric services, 52.8\% of these
              had experienced problems in the transition from paediatric to
              adult services. Only 20.3\% knew of a patient registry for their
              condition and 24.8\% were informed of clinical trials.
              CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that not all healthcare needs
              of people living with rare diseases are being met. Structural
              changes to Australian healthcare systems may be required to
              improve the integration and coordination of diagnosis and care.
              Health professionals may need greater awareness of rare diseases
              to improve the diagnostic process and support to meet the
              information requirements of people newly diagnosed with rare
              diseases. Health service use is likely higher than for the
              general population and further epidemiological studies are needed
              on the impact of rare diseases on the healthcare system.",

              or extremely rare, making clinical interpretation problematic and
              genotype-phenotype correlations uncertain. Identification of
              patients sharing a genomic rearrangement and having phenotypic
              features in common leads to greater certainty in the pathogenic
              nature of the rearrangement and enables new syndromes to be
              defined. To facilitate the analysis of these rare events, we have
              developed an interactive web-based database called DECIPHER
              (Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans Using
              Ensembl Resources) which incorporates a suite of tools designed
              to aid the interpretation of submicroscopic chromosomal
              imbalance, inversions, and translocations. DECIPHER catalogs
              common copy-number changes in normal populations and thus, by
              exclusion, enables changes that are novel and potentially
              pathogenic to be identified. DECIPHER enhances genetic counseling
              by retrieving relevant information from a variety of
              bioinformatics resources. Known and predicted genes within an
              aberration are listed in the DECIPHER patient report, and genes
              of recognized clinical importance are highlighted and
              prioritized. DECIPHER enables clinical scientists worldwide to
              maintain records of phenotype and chromosome rearrangement for
              their patients and, with informed consent, share this information
              with the wider clinical research community through display in the
              genome browser Ensembl. By sharing cases worldwide, clusters of
              rare cases having phenotype and structural rearrangement in

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Several groups and resources provide information that
              pertains to the validity of gene-disease relationships used in
              genomic medicine and research; however, universal standards and
              terminologies to define the evidence base for the role of a gene
              in disease and a single harmonized resource were lacking. To
              tackle this issue, the Gene Curation Coalition (GenCC) was
              formed. METHODS: The GenCC drafted harmonized definitions for
              differing levels of gene-disease validity on the basis of
              existing resources, and performed a modified Delphi survey with 3
              rounds to narrow the list of terms. The GenCC also developed a
              unified database to display curated gene-disease validity
              assertions from its members. RESULTS: On the basis of 241 survey
              responses from the genetics community, a consensus term set was
              chosen for grading gene-disease validity and database
              submissions. As of December 2021, the database contained 15,241
              gene-disease assertions on 4569 unique genes from 12 submitters.
              When comparing submissions to the database from distinct sources,
              conflicts in assertions of gene-disease validity ranged from
              5.3\% to 13.4\%. CONCLUSION: Terminology standardization, sharing
              of gene-disease validity classifications, and resolution of
              curation conflicts will facilitate collaborations across
              international curation efforts and in turn, improve consistency

              diagnosis of disease for diverse applications such as variant
              prioritization, deep phenotyping, and patient profile-matching.
              We have migrated our system into a scalable, cloud-based
              infrastructure; simplified Monarch's data ingestion and knowledge
              graph integration systems; enhanced data mapping and integration
              standards; and developed a new user interface with novel search
              and graph navigation features. Furthermore, we advanced Monarch's
              analytic tools by developing a customized plugin for OpenAI's
              ChatGPT to increase the reliability of its responses about
              phenotypic data, allowing us to interrogate the knowledge in the

  abstract = "There are approximately 6000 rare diseases, and 80\% of them are
              genetic. In Europe, a disease is considered rare when it affects
              no more than one person in 2000. In France, two to three million
              people are affected, while nearly 30 million others are affected
              across Europe (5-8\% of the whole European population). The
              majority of rare diseases are poorly understood by health
              professionals. Due to the lack of sufficient scientific and
              medical knowledge, many patients are misdiagnosed, which results
              in delays in care that can be harmful. Because many rare diseases
              are often associated with neurological manifestations, the
              neurologist in his daily practice may often encounter these
              complex diseases that require special care as well as a
              multidisciplinary approach. Orphanet is the reference portal for
              rare diseases. Freely accessible on the Internet, it is a
              non-profit service officially supported by the French Ministry of
              Health and the European Commission. Its mission is to keep
              healthcare professionals and patients informed and, by so doing,
              it contributes to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of
              rare diseases. It is currently the only project that establishes
              a link between diseases and any published information concerning
              them, and the appropriate services for patients as well as
              healthcare professionals. Orphanet is currently the most
              comprehensive site in terms of referenced and documented data,
              and it has in just a few years become the global reference portal
              for rare diseases and orphan drugs for all audiences. Orphanet
              generates a million page views per month. The site is available
              in six languages (English, French, Spanish, Italian, German and
              Portuguese) and offers a range of services, including: an
              inventory, classification and peer-reviewed encyclopedia of rare
              diseases along with the associated genes (more than 2000 diseases
              with neurological manifestations are described); a diagnostic
              support tool; clinical and emergency guidelines; a directory of
              specialised services in 37 partner countries; an encyclopedia
              aimed at the general public; an inventory of orphan drugs;
              downloadable thematic studies and reports on such subjects as the
              prevalence of rare diseases, orphan drugs, aids and services for
              patients; and numerous links to other sources of information.
              Five to ten new rare diseases are described every month, which
              represents a major challenge for health professionals in terms of
              keeping their knowledge up to date. The Orphanet website content

              destructive lung disease and were first described in 2014. Early
              reports suggest that CCNO is mutated more frequently than
              expected, however, these are considered rare. We report on three
              eleven-year-old children with PCD due to CCNO mutations. All
              children presented early-onset respiratory symptoms, no cardiac
              or situs anomalies and moderate to severe clinical courses.
              Patients 1 and 3 were admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit
              due to respiratory distress. Patients 1 and 2 had atelectasis and
              lobar collapse, for which lobectomy was performed for patient 1.
              Patient 3 also presented otitis media with effusion with
              conductive hearing loss, requiring tympanostomy tube insertion
              twice. Diagnosis of PCD for all three required repeated nasal
              brushings, delaying diagnostic confirmation. Microscopy analysis
              revealed severely decreased numbers of cilia, but normal
              ultrastructure and uncoordinated beat pattern in the residual
              cilia. Surprisingly, the prevalence of pathogenic CCNO variants
              in our centre is higher than expected (three out of sixteen
              patients). Pathogenic variants in PCD-causing genes lead to
              specific ultrastructural defects, and there is a suggestion for
              genotype-phenotype association. However, there are little
              longitudinal data evaluating the impact of specific defects on
              disease progression, but a recent study showed a worse lung
              disease and poorer nutritional status. Concluding, this report

  abstract = "SOX2 is a transcription factor conserved throughout vertebrate
              evolution, whose expression marks the central nervous system from
              the earliest developmental stages. In humans, SOX2 mutation leads
              to a spectrum of CNS defects, including vision and hippocampus
              impairments, intellectual disability, and motor control problems.
              Here, we review how conditional Sox2 knockout (cKO) in mouse with
              different Cre recombinases leads to very diverse phenotypes in
              different regions of the developing and postnatal brain.
              Surprisingly, despite the widespread expression of Sox2 in neural
              stem/progenitor cells of the developing neural tube, some regions
              (hippocampus, ventral forebrain) appear much more vulnerable than
              others to Sox2 deletion. Furthermore, the stage of Sox2 deletion
              is also a critical determinant of the resulting defects, pointing
              to a stage-specificity of SOX2 function. Finally, cKOs illuminate
              the importance of SOX2 function in different cell types according
              to the different affected brain regions (neural precursors,
              GABAergic interneurons, glutamatergic projection neurons,

              brain defects identified in patients carrying mutations within
              human SOX2 and examine the parallels with mouse mutants.
              Functional genomics approaches have started to identify SOX2

              have a point prevalence of <1/1 000 000. However 77.3-80.7\% of
              the population burden of rare diseases is attributable to the
              4.2\% (n = 149) diseases in the most common prevalence range (1-5
              per 10 000). Consequently national definitions of 'Rare Diseases'
              (ranging from prevalence of 5 to 80 per 100 000) represent a
              variable number of rare disease patients despite sharing the
              majority of rare disease in their scope. Our analysis yields a
              conservative, evidence-based estimate for the population
              prevalence of rare diseases of 3.5-5.9\%, which equates to
              263-446 million persons affected globally at any point in time.
              This figure is derived from data from 67.6\% of the prevalent
              rare diseases; using the European definition of 5 per 10 000; and
              excluding rare cancers, infectious diseases, and poisonings.

              codification in healthcare systems will further refine the

              range of serious diseases. This requires an ability to circumvent
              the innate immune system to establish an infection. Professional
              phagocytes, primarily macrophages and neutrophils, are key innate
              immune cells which interact with S. aureus, acting as gatekeepers

              using a wide array of killing mechanisms. In defense, S. aureus
              has evolved multiple strategies to survive within, manipulate and

              are caused by various mutations in the POU domain class 3
              transcription factor 4 (POU3F4) gene. This study aimed to
              identify allelic variants of this gene in two Chinese families
              displaying X-linked inheritance deafness-2 (DFNX2) and one
              sporadic case with indefinite inheritance pattern. METHODS:
              Direct DNA sequencing of the POU3F4 gene was performed in these
              families and in 100 Chinese individuals with normal hearing.
              RESULTS: There are characteristic imaging findings in DFNX2
              Chinese families with POU3F4 mutations. The temporal bone
              computed tomography (CT) images of patients with DFNX2 are
              characterized by a thickened stapes footplate, hypoplasia of the
              cochlear base, absence of the bony modiolus, and dilated internal
              acoustic meatus (IAM) as well as by abnormally wide communication
              between the IAM and the basal turn of the cochlea. We identified
              three causative mutations in POU3F4 for three probands and their
              extended families. In family 1468, we observed a novel deletion
              mutation, c.973delT, which is predicted to result in a
              p.Trp325Gly amino acid frameshift. In family 2741, the mutation
              c.927delCTC was identified, which is predicted to result in the
              deletion of serine at position 310. In both families, the
              mutations were located in the POU homeodomain and are predicted
              to truncate the C-terminus of the POU domain. In the third
              family, a novel de novo transversion mutation (c.669 T > A) was
              identified in a 5-year-old boy that resulted in a nonsense
              mutation (p.Tyr223*). The mutation created a new stop codon and
              is predicted to result in a truncated POU3F4 protein.
              CONCLUSIONS: Based on characteristic radiological findings and
              clinical features, POU3F4 gene mutation analysis will increase
              the success rate of stapes operations and cochlear implantations,
