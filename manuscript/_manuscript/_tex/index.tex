\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Rare diseases (RDs) are a highly heterogeneous and underserved group of
conditions. Most RDs have a strong genetic basis but their causal
pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. We therefore
systematically characterised the cell type--specific mechanisms for all
genetically defined RD phenotypes by integrating the Human Phenotype
Ontology with whole-body single-cell transcriptomic atlases from
embryonic, foetal, and adult samples. This revealed significant
associations between 201 cell types and 9,575/11,028 (86.7\%) phenotypes
across 8,628 RDs, substantially expanding knowledge of phenotype--cell
type links. We then prioritised phenotypes for clinical impact based on
severity (e.g.~lethality, motor/mental impairment) and gene therapy
compatibility (e.g.~cell type specificity, postnatal treatability). All
results are reproducible and freely available, including via an
interactive web portal
(\url{https://neurogenomics-ukdri.dsi.ic.ac.uk/}), representing a major
advance toward treating patients across a broad spectrum of serious RDs.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{sec-introduction}

Rare diseases (RDs) are individually uncommon but collectively this
class of over 10,000 conditions affects 300--400 million people
worldwide (1 in 10--20 individuals)\textsuperscript{1,2}, 75\% of RD
patients are children, with a 30\% rate mortality by age
five\textsuperscript{3}. Diagnosis is challenging due to highly variable
presentations, averaging five years\textsuperscript{4}, with
\textasciitilde46\% misdiagnosed and \textgreater75\% never
diagnosed\textsuperscript{5}. Prognosis is similarly difficult.
Treatments exist for \textless5\% of RDs\textsuperscript{6} and high
development costs for small patient populations deter
investment\textsuperscript{7,8}, making these therapies among the
world's most expensive\textsuperscript{9,10}. High-throughput
therapeutic discovery could lower costs and speed delivery.

A major barrier in research and clinical care of diseases is
inconsistent medical terminology. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)
provides a unified, hierarchical framework of 18,082 phenotypes spanning
10,300 RDs\textsuperscript{11--13}, integrated into diagnostics and
linked to other ontologies (e.g.~SNOMED CT, UMLS, ICD). Over 80\% of RDs
have known genetic causes\textsuperscript{14}, with HPO gene annotations
curated from OMIM, Orphanet, DECIPHER, and case reports. Yet gene lists
alone lack the tissue and cell type context essential for understanding
pathogenesis and improving diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) now enables transcriptome-wide profiling
at cellular resolution\textsuperscript{15--17}. Comprehensive atlases
such as Descartes Human\textsuperscript{18} and Human Cell
Landscape\textsuperscript{19} cover embryonic to adult stages across
tissues, providing gene signatures for hundreds of cell subtypes.
Integrating RD gene annotations with these profiles reveals the specific
cell types through which genes act, including understudied cell types.

Cell type-specific mechanisms are critical for guiding the development
of effective therapeutics, especially virally-mediated gene
therapies\textsuperscript{20,21}. Knowledge of the specific causal cell
types can enhance efficacy and improve safety by avoiding off-target
effects. To facilitate these key insights, we developed a
high-throughput pipeline to nominate cell type--resolved gene therapy
targets across thousands of RD phenotypes, ranked by composite phenotype
severity scores\textsuperscript{22}. This work expands knowledge of the
cell types, organ systems, and life stages underlying RDs, with direct
applications to precision therapeutic development.

evidence linking each gene and each phenotype (using the Human Phenotype
Ontology and GenCC databases). We then created gene signature profiles
for all cell types in the Descartes Human and Human Cell Landscape
scRNA-seq atlases. Finally, we iteratively ran generalised linear
regression tests between all pairwise combinations of phenotype gene
signatures and cell type gene signatures. The resulting associations
were then used to nominate cell type-resolved gene therapy targets for
thousands of rare diseases.}

\subsection{Results}\label{sec-results}

\subsubsection{Phenotype-cell type
associations}\label{phenotype-cell-type-associations}

We systematically investigated cell types underlying HPO phenotypes,
hypothesising that genes with cell type--specific expression are most
relevant to those cell types, and that disrupting such genes will have
variable effects across cell types. More precisely, for each phenotype
we created a list of associated genes weighted by the strength of the
evidence supporting those associations, imported from the Gene Curation
Coalition (GenCC)\textsuperscript{23}. Analogously, we created mean gene
expression profiles for each cell type using scRNA-seq atlases and then
normlaized them to compute cell type specificity of gene expression (see
\textbf{Methods} subsection \emph{Single-cell transcriptomic atlases}
for further details).

For comprehensiveness, we used two pan-tissue scRNA-seq atlases:
Descartes Human (\textasciitilde4 million single-nuclei and single-cells
from 15 foetal tissues)\textsuperscript{18} and Human Cell Landscape
(\textasciitilde703,000 single-cells from 49 embryonic, foetal and adult
tissues)\textsuperscript{19}. For every unique combination of phenotype
and cell type, we trained a generalized linear regression model to test
for association between the respective gene-phenotype association scores
and gene-cell type expression specificity scores
(Fig.~\ref{fig-study-design}). We then applied stringent multiple
testing correction to control the false discovery rate (FDR) across all
tests, and significant phenotype--cell type associations were identified
at FDR\textless0.05.

In Descartes Human, 19,929/ 848,078 (2.35\%) tests were significant
across 77 cell types and 7,340 phenotypes. In Human Cell Landscape, the
corresponding values were 1.96\% significant tests, 124 cell types, and
9,049 phenotypes, with more phenotypes linked to at least one cell type
due to greater cell type diversity and life-stage coverage. Across both
atlases, the median number of significant cell types per phenotype was
3, indicating specificity of associations. Overall, 8,628/8,631
(\textgreater99.96\%) of diseases had significant cell type associations
for at least one phenotype. Full stratified results are provided in
Table~\ref{tbl-summary}.

\subsubsection{Validation of expected phenotype-cell type
relationships}\label{validation-of-expected-phenotype-cell-type-relationships}

We intuit that organ system-specific abnormalities are often driven by
cell types within that system. The HPO's high-level categories allow
systematic testing; for example, heart phenotypes should typically
involve cardiocytes, and nervous system abnormalities should involve
neural cells. All cell types in our single-cell atlases were mapped to
the Cell Ontology (CL), a hierarchical vocabulary of cell types.

A cell type was considered \emph{on-target} for an HPO branch if it
belonged to a matching CL branch (Table~\ref{tbl-ontarget-celltypes}).
For each HPO branch (Fig.~\ref{fig-summary}b), we tested whether cell
types were more often associated with phenotypes in that branch compared
to all others, and identified those overrepresented at FDR\textless0.05.
All 7 HPO branches showed disproportionate associations with on-target
cell types from their respective organ systems.

We hypothesised that more strongly significant phenotype--cell type
associations are more likely to be on-target. Grouping
\(-log_{10}(\text{p-values})\) into six bins, we calculated the
proportion of on-target cell types per HPO--CL branch pairing. Indeed,
this proportion consistently increased with association significance
(\(r_{Pearson}=\)\(0.63\), \(p=\)\(1.1 \times 10^{-6}\)). For example,
in nervous system abnormalities neural cells constituted only \(23\)\%
of all tested cell types, yet made up \(46\)\% of associations within
the \(-log_{10}(\text{p-values}) \ge 6\) bin (which corresponds to
\(p\ge 10^{-7}\)). This confirms that stronger associations are more
likely to involve on-target cell types, confirming our association
strategy captures real relationships.

\subsubsection{Validation of inter- and intra-dataset
consistency}\label{validation-of-inter--and-intra-dataset-consistency}

If our methodology works, it should yield consistent phenotype-cell type
associations across different datasets. We therefore tested for the
consistency of our results across the two single-cell reference datasets
(Descartes Human vs.~Human Cell Landscape) across the subset of
overlapping cell types Fig.~\ref{fig-ctd-correlation}. In total there
were 142,285 phenotype-cell type associations to compare across the two
datasets (across 10,945 phenotypes and 13 cell types annotated to the
exact same CL term. We found that the correlation between p-values of
the two datasets was high (\(rho\)=\(0.49\),
\(p\)=\(1.1 \times 10^{-93}\)). Within the subset of results that were
significant in both single-cell datasets (FDR\textless0.05), we found
that degree of correlation between the association effect sizes across
datasets was even stronger (\(r_{Pearson}=\)\(0.72\),
\(p=\)\(1.1 \times 10^{-93}\)). We also checked for the intra-dataset
consistency between the p-values of the foetal and adult samples in the
Human Cell Landscape, showing a very similar degree of correlation as
the inter-dataset comparison (\(r_{Pearson}=\)\(0.44\),
\(p=\)\(2.4 \times 10^{-149}\)). Together, these results suggest that
our approach to identifying phenotype-cell type associations is highly
replicable and generalisable to new datasets.

\subsubsection{More specific phenotypes are associated with fewer genes
and cell
types}\label{more-specific-phenotypes-are-associated-with-fewer-genes-and-cell-types}

Higher levels of the ontology are broad classes of phenotype
(e.g.~`Abnormality of the nervous system') while the lower levels can
get very detailed (e.g.~`Spinocerebellar atrophy'). The higher level
phenotypes inherit all genes associated with lower level phenotypes, so
naturally they have more genes than the lower level phenotypes
(Fig.~\ref{fig-ontology-lvl}a; \(r_{Pearson}=\)\(-0.56\),
\(p=\)\(2.2 \times 10^{-308}\)).

Next, we reasoned that the more detailed and specific a phenotype is,
the more likely it is to be driven by one cell type. For example, while
`Neurodevelopmental abnormality' could plausibly be driven by any/all
cell types in the brain, it is more likely that `Impaired visuospatial
constructive cognition' is driven by fewer cell types. This was indeed
the case, as we observed a strongly significant negative correlation
between the two variables (Fig.~\ref{fig-ontology-lvl}b;
\(r_{Pearson}=\)\(-0.49\), \(p=\)\(2.2 \times 10^{-308}\)). We also
found that the phenotype-cell type association effect size increased
with greater phenotype specificity, reflecting the decreasing overall
number of associated cell types at each ontological level
(Fig.~\ref{fig-ontology-lvl}c; \(r_{Pearson}=\)\(0.13\),
\(p=\)\(8.3 \times 10^{-160}\)).

ontology term specificity. Terms with lower IC represent the broadest
HPO terms (e.g.~`All'), while terms with higher IC indicate

\subsubsection{Validation of phenotype-cell type associations using
biomedical knowledge
graphs}\label{validation-of-phenotype-cell-type-associations-using-biomedical-knowledge-graphs}

To validate phenotype--cell type associations without literature bias,
we used the Monarch Knowledge Graph (MKG), a curated database of
biomedical concepts and relationships containing 103 known
associations\textsuperscript{25}.\\
The MKG served as a benchmark for the field's current knowledge. For
each MKG association, we calculated the proportion of cell types
recovered in our results at different ontological distances in the Cell
Ontology. Distance 0 indicates the closest possible match
(e.g.~``monocyte'' vs.~``monocyte''), with greater distances reflecting
progressively broader matches (e.g.~distance 1: ``monocyte''
vs.~``classical monocyte''). The theoretical maximum recall was capped
by the percentage of MKG phenotypes for which we identified at least one
significant association (\(FDR_{pc}\)). In other words, since our
results only contain significant cell type associations for 90\% of the
phenotypes in the MKG's phenotype-cell type associations, our maximum
achievable performance was 90\% recall.

Our results included at least one significant cell type for \(90\)\% of
MKG phenotypes. At distance 0, we recalled \(57\)\% of associations; at
distance 1, recall rose to \(77\)\%, reaching a maximum of \(90\)\% at
the largest allowed distance. Precision could not be computed, as MKG
lists only true positives. Overall, these benchmarks show that our
approach recovers most known phenotype--cell type associations while
generating many novel ones.

\subsubsection{Phenome-wide analyses discover novel phenotype-cell type
associations}\label{phenome-wide-analyses-discover-novel-phenotype-cell-type-associations}

Having confirmed many phenotype-cell type associations match prior
expectations, we explored novel links for undercharacterised phenotypes.
`Recurrent bacterial infections' (\(19\) descendants,
e.g.~staphylococcal, streptococcal, Neisserial) mostly associated with
immune cells (e.g.~macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, monocytes,
neutrophils) (Fig.~\ref{fig-rni}). Known links include `Recurrent
staphylococcal infections' with myeloid cells\textsuperscript{26--29},
where monocytes were most strongly associated
(FDR=\(1.0 \times 10^{-30}\), \(\beta\)=\(0.18\)). Notably, amongst the
recurrent bacterial infection phenotypes, hepatoblasts were exclusively
associated with `Recurrent Neisserial infections', hereafter RNI
(Descartes Human: FDR=\(1.1 \times 10^{-6}\),
\(\beta\)=\(8.2 \times 10^{-2}\)).

\caption{\label{fig-rni}}

\end{figure}%

To better understand the multi-scale mechanisms underlying RNI
susceptibility, we visualised the putative causal relationships between
genes, cell types and diseases associated with RNI as a network
(Fig.~\ref{fig-network-rni}). The phenotype RNI was connected to cell
types through the aforementioned association test results
(FDR\textless0.05). Genes that were primarily driving these associations
(i.e.~genes that were both strongly linked with RNI and were highly
specifically expressed in the given cell type) were designated as
``driver genes'' and retained for plotting (see \textbf{Methods} for
details). While a gene being non-specifically expressed does not
necessarily mean it is unimportant for the function of a cell (many
ubiquitously expressed genes are essential for cell function), gene
expression specificity is nevertheless a useful metric to unambiguously
link cell types to other biological entities (e.g.~phenotypes). Diseases
were then connected to phenotypes and gene nodes based on HPO
annotations. Finally, diseases were also connected to cell types as a
transitive property of being connected to phenotypes, but only if the
disease gene set overlapped with 25\% or more of the driver genes for
that particular phenotype-cell type relationship (see \textbf{Methods}
subsection \emph{Symptom-cell type associations} and {[}Fig.
fig-diagram{]} for further explanation).

Using this network-based approach, we found that RNI (a phenotype of 7
diseases: `C5 deficiency', `C6 deficiency', `C7 deficiency', `Complement
component 8 deficiency, type II', `Complement factor B deficiency',
`Complement factor I deficiency', `Mannose-Binding lectin deficiency')
was also linked to stromal cells (FDR=\(4.6 \times 10^{-6}\),
\(\beta\)=\(7.9 \times 10^{-2}\)), stratified epithelial cells
(FDR=\(1.7 \times 10^{-23}\), \(\beta\)=\(0.15\)), and embryonic stem
cells (FDR=\(5.4 \times 10^{-5}\), \(\beta\)=\(7.4 \times 10^{-2}\)).
All of the gene implicated in this causal network are part of the
complement system (\emph{C5}, \emph{C6}, \emph{C8B}, \emph{CFB},
\emph{CFI}, \emph{MBL2}, and \emph{C7}). Complement deficiences are
known to cause a marked susceptibility to
infection\textsuperscript{30,31}. However, the complement system
comprises more than 56 genes and can be expressed in a wide variety of
cell types\textsuperscript{32}. Our analysis was able to decompose the
multiple mechanisms underlying RNI into subsets of complement proteins
and identify the specific cell types they each affect. For example,
disruptions in complement genes \emph{C5}, \emph{C8}, and \emph{C7}
cause RNI via hepatoblasts, stratified epithelial cells, and stromal
cells, respectively (Supp. Fig.~\ref{fig-network-rni}). These four cell
types may represent disease subtypes with distinct clinical courses or
biomarkers, allowing us to begin resolving RNI-related disease
mechanisms at cell-type resolution.

In particular, we were intrigued by the finding that hepatoblasts were
associated with RNI but their mature counterpart, hepatocytes, were not.
Mature hepatocytes are well recognised as the principal source of
complement proteins\textsuperscript{33}. However, emerging evidence
indicates that foetal hepatoblasts also express detectable amounts of
complement genes\textsuperscript{35}, which we confirmed by querying the
CellxGene browser\textsuperscript{36} (see \textbf{Data Availability}).
Upon further inspection, we found that these were in fact circulating
hepatoblast-like cells found in liver, placenta and spleen, according to
the authors of the Descartes scRNA-seq atlas\textsuperscript{37}. These
cells express high levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFB), serum albumin
(ALB), and apolipoproteins (including APOE). Our results support this
hypothesis as these AFB+/ALB+ cells were significantly associated with
12 liver-related phenotypes, as well as 58 blood-related phenotypes.
Together, these findings suggest that these hepatoblast-like cell
subpopulations play a causal role in complement-related disorders during
development. However, this relatively novel cell type must be better
charactised before drawing any firm conclusions.

\subsubsection{Prioritising phenotypes based on
severity}\label{prioritising-phenotypes-based-on-severity}

Some phenotypes are more severe than others and thus could be
prioritised for treatment (e.g.~`Leukonychia' is far less severe than
`Leukodystrophy'). To systematically rank phenotypes, we used GPT-4 to
annotate severity for 16,982/18,082 (\(94\)\%) HPO
phenotypes\textsuperscript{22}. Benchmarking against ground-truth HPO
branch annotations showed high accuracy (recall=\(96\)\%, min=\(89\)\%,
max=\(100\)\%, SD=\(4.5\)\%) and strong consistency (\(91\)\%). From
these, we computed weighted severity scores (0--100) for all phenotypes.
The most severe was `Atrophy/Degeneration affecting the central nervous
system' (\emph{HP:0007367}, score=\(47\)), followed by `Anencephaly'
(\emph{HP:0002323}, score=\(45\)). There were 677 phenotypes with score
0 (e.g.~`Thin toenail'), mean=\(10\) (median=\(9.4\)).

Merging severity scores with significant (FDR\textless0.05)
phenotype--cell type associations revealed that neuronal brush cells had
the highest average severity, followed by Mueller cells and glial cells,
while megakaryocytes had the lowest. Numerically encoding GPT
annotations (0--3) and applying Wilcoxon tests confirmed expected links,
e.g.~retinal pigment epithelial cells with blindness, ventricular
cardiac muscle cells with death, and analogous patterns for reduced
fertility, immunodeficiency, impaired mobility, and cancer. Finally, we
found that cell types associated with more phenotypes also tended to
have higher mean composite severity (\(p=\)\(7.9 \times 10^{-4}\),
\(\hat{\rho}_{Spearman}\)=\(0.33\)), supporting the idea that broadly
involved cell types perform critical physiological functions whose
disruption causes more severe disease.

performed for each cell type (within each GPT annotation) to determine
which cell types more frequently caused severe phenotypes than all other
cell types. Dots are colored by \(-log_2(FDR)\) when Wilcoxon test FDR

\subsubsection{Congenital phenotypes are associated with foetal cell
types}\label{congenital-phenotypes-are-associated-with-foetal-cell-types}

The life stage at which a phenotype manifests affects treatment options,
as some interventions (e.g.~gene therapies) may be ineffective once
developmental defects occur. In the DescartesHuman dataset all cells
were foetal, while the Human Cell Landscape included both
embryonic/foetal (\(29\)\% of cell types), and adult tissues (\(71\)\%
of cell types). Some cell types exist in both stages
(e.g.~chondrocytes), while others are foetal-specific (e.g.~neural crest
cells). Congenital phenotypes (according to our severity annotations)
were strongly associated with foetal cell types
(\(p=\)\(4.7 \times 10^{-261}\), \(\chi^2=\)\(1.2 \times 10^{3}\)),
consistent with their developmental origins.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{\label{fig-congenital}}

\end{figure}%

HPO branches varied significantly in the proportion of their significant
assocations with foetal cell types (\(\hat{V}_{Cramer}\)=\(0.22\),
\(p<\)\(2.2 \times 10^{-308}\)). Branches with the most disproportiate
number of foetal cell type associations were `Abnormality of limbs'
(\(35\)\%), `Growth abnormality' (\(32\)\%), and `Abnormality of the
musculoskeletal system' (\(29\)\%). The most adult-biased brances were
`Abnormality of blood and blood-forming tissues' (\(97\)\%) and
`Abnormality of the immune system' (\(96\)\%).

Some phenotypes involve only foetal or only adult versions of a cell
type. We quantified bias by comparing association p-values between
foetal and adult versions of the same type (metric range: 1=foetal-only,
-1=adult-only). The top \(50\) foetal-biased phenotypes revealed were
enriched for the HPO branches `Abnormal nasal morphology'
(\(p=\)\(2.4 \times 10^{-7}\)) and `Abnormal external nose morphology'
(\(p=\)\(2.5 \times 10^{-6}\)), which included specific phenotypes such
as . Adult-biased phenotypes were instead enriched for the branches
`Abnormal elasticity of skin' (\(p=\)\(3.6 \times 10^{-7}\)) and
`Abnormally lax or hyperextensible skin' (\(p=\)\(1.3 \times 10^{-5}\)),
with examples like `Excessive wrinkled skin' and `Paroxysmal
supraventricular tachycardia'. These align with known developmental and
age-related processes, supporting our approach for linking phenotypes to
causal cell types.

\subsubsection{Therapeutic target
identification}\label{therapeutic-target-identification}

In the above sections, we demonstrated how gene association databases
can be used to investigate the cell types underlying disease phenotypes
at scale. While these associations are informative on their own, we
wished to take these results further in order to have a more
translational impact. Knowledge of the causal cell types underlying each
phenotype can be highly informative for scientists and clinicians in
their quest to study and treat them. Therapeutic targets with supportive
genetic evidence have 2.6x higher success rates in clinical
trials\textsuperscript{39--41}. Furthermore, knowing which cell types to
target with gene therapy can maximise the efficacy of highly expensive
payloads, and minimise side effects (e.g.~immune reaction to viral
vectors). Recent biotechnological advances have greatly enhanced our
ability to target specific cell types with gene therapy, making specific
and accurate knowledge the correct underlying cell types more pertinent
than ever\textsuperscript{20,21}.

Rather than consider phenotypes in isolation, or even phenotype
associations with particular cell types, we sought to identify
multi-scale therapeutic targets. That is, specific genes to target in
specific cell types in specific phenotypes as they present in particular
diseases. The confluence of these pieces of information is crucial for
clinical utility, as it provides the much-needed context to develop
effective therapeutics for real-world patient populations. For example,
the same phenotype may be caused by disruptions to one of several cell
types, each of which are in turn caused by mutations to particular
genes. Networks are a natural way to visualize the complex relationships
between these various biological entities, and using sensible filters
(i.e.~pruning) keeps the networks small enough to gain meaningful
insights through visual exploration.

Towards this objective, we developed an automated pipeline to identify
putative cell type--specific gene targets for each phenotype by
integrating phenotype--cell type association results with primary
resources such as GenCC gene--disease relationships and scRNA-seq atlas
datasets, producing a table where each row represented a
disease--phenotype--cell type--gene tetrad. We applied sequential
filters to retain only significant phenotype--cell type associations
(\(FDR<0.05\)), phenotype--gene pairs with strong causal evidence (GenCC
score \textgreater{} 3), phenotypes with high specificity (\(IC>8\)),
and gene--cell type links in the top 25\% expression specificity
quantile, and further required a symptom intersection \textgreater{}
0.25 when linking cell types to diseases via phenotypes. The filtered
results were ranked by GPT-4 composite severity scores, with only the
top 10 tetrads retained per phenotype, yielding compact, high-confidence
networks suitable for manual inspection and visualization.

This yielded putative therapeutic targets for 5,252 phenotypes across
4,819 diseases in 201 cell types and 3,148 genes (Supp.
Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-filter}). While this constitutes a large number of
genes in total, each phenotype was assigned a median of \(2.0\) gene
targets (mean=\(3.3\), min=1, max=10). Relative to the number of genes
annotations per phenotype in the HPO overall (median=\(7.0\),
mean=\(62\), min=1, max=5,003) this represents a substantial decrease in
the number of candidate target genes, even when excluding high-level
phenotypes (HPO level\textgreater{}\(3.0\)). It is also important to
note that the phenotypes in the prioritised targets list are ranked by
their severity, allowing us to distinguish between phenotypes with a
high medical urgency (e.g.~`Hydranencephaly') from those with lower
medical urgency (e.g.~`Increased mean corpuscular volume'). This can be
useful for clinicians, biomedical scientists, and pharmaceutical
manufacturers who wish to focus their research efforts on phenotypes
with the greatest need for intervention.

Across all phenotypes, epithelial cell were most commonly implicated
(838 phenotypes), followed by stromal cell (626 phenotypes), stromal
cell (626 phenotypes), neuron (475 phenotypes), chondrocyte (383
phenotypes), and endothelial cell (361 phenotypes). Grouped by
higher-order ontology category, `Abnormality of the musculoskeletal
system' had the greatest number of enriched phenotypes (959 phenotypes,
857 genes), followed by `Abnormality of the nervous system' (733
phenotypes, 1,138 genes), `Abnormality of head or neck' (543 phenotypes,
986 genes), `Abnormality of the genitourinary system' (443 phenotypes,
695 genes), and `Abnormality of the eye' (377 phenotypes, 545 genes).

\subsubsection{Therapeutic target
validation}\label{therapeutic-target-validation}

To determine whether the genes prioritised by our therapeutic targets
pipeline were plausible, we checked what percentage of gene therapy
targets we recapitulated. Data on therapeutic approval status was
gathered from the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD; release
2025-11-18)\textsuperscript{42}. Overall, we prioritised \(87\)\% (120
total) of all non-failed existing gene therapy targets (ie. those which
are currently approved, investigative, or undergoing clinical trials). A
hypergeometric test confirmed that our prioritised targets were
significantly enriched for non-failed gene therapy targets
(\(p=\)\(5.6 \times 10^{-5}\), \(\text{odds ratio=}\)\(3.0\),
\(\text{sensitivity}\)=\(0.83\), \(\text{specificity}\)=\(0.38\)). For
these hypergeometric tests, the background gene set was composed of the
union of all phenotype-associated genes in the HPO and all gene therapy
targets listed in TTD.

Even when considering therapeutics of any kind (Supp.
Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-validate-all}), not just gene therapies, we
recapitulated \(40\)\% of the non-failed therapeutic targets and 0\% of
the terminated/withdrawn therapeutic targets (n=1,255). Here we found
that our prioritised targets were highly significantly depleted for
failed therapeutics ((\(p=\)\(4.4 \times 10^{-23}\),
\(\text{odds ratio=}\)\(0.36\), \(\text{sensitivity}\)=\(0.27\),
\(\text{specificity}\)=\(0.49\))). This suggests that our multi-scale
evidence-based prioritisation pipeline is capable of selectively
identifying genes that are likely to be effective therapeutic targets.

In addition to aggregate enrichment results, we also provide specific
examples of successful gene therapies whose cell type-specific mechanism
were recapitulated by our phenotype-cell associations. In particular,
our pipeline nominated the gene \emph{RPE65} within `retinal pigment
epithelial cells' as the top target for `Fundus atrophy' vision-related
phenotypes that are hallmarks of `Leber congenital amaurosis, type II'
and `Severe early-childhood-onset retinal dystrophy'. Indeed, gene
therapies targeting \emph{RPE65} within the retina of patients with
these rare genetic conditions are some of the most successful clinical
applications of this technology to date, able to restore vision in many
cases\textsuperscript{43}. In other cases, a tissue (e.g.~liver) may be
known to be causally involved in disease genesis, but the precise causal
cell types within that tissue remain unknown (e.g.~heptocytes, Kupffer
cells, Cholangiocytes, Hepatic stellate cells, Natural killer cells,
etc.). Tissue-level investigations (e.g.~using bulk transcriptomics or
epigenomics) would be dominated by hepatocytes, which comprise 75\% of
the liver. Our prioritized gene therapy targets can aid in such
scenarios by providing the cell type-resolution context most likely to
be causal for a given phenotype or set of phenotypes.

From our prioritised targets, we selected four phenotype or disease
examples: `GM2-ganglioside accumulation', `Spinocerebellar atrophy',
`Neuronal loss in central nervous system'. To focus on clinically
relevant phenotypes and reduce overplotting, we limited selection to
those with GPT severity scores above \(15\) Supp.
Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples2}. Selection was based on severity and
network simplicity to allow compact visualisation.

Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a fatal neurodegenerative condition caused by
\emph{HEXA} deficiency and ganglioside buildup. We identified
alternatively activated macrophages as the cell type most associated
with `GM2-ganglioside accumulation' Supp.
Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples2}. This aligns with prior findings of
ganglioside accumulation in TSD
macrophages\textsuperscript{44,45.,46,47}. Our results support
macrophages as causal in TSD and the most promising therapeutic target.

Spinocerebellar atrophy is a progressive neurodegenerative phenotype in
disorders like Spinocerebellar ataxia. Our pipeline implicates M2
macrophages (`Alternatively activated macrophages') as the only causal
cell type Supp. Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples2}. This suggests Purkinje
cell loss is downstream of macrophage dysfunction, consistent with
microglial roles in neurodegeneration\textsuperscript{48--50}. Our
findings provide the first statistically supported link between risk
genes and this cell type, which is supported by relevant mouse models
(e.g.~\emph{Atxn1}, \emph{Pnpla6}) that replicate cellular and
behavioural disease phenotypes.

`Neuronal loss in the central nervous system' is a phenotype by multiple
serious diseases (e.g.~Huntington disease, frontotemporal lobar
degeneration, and certain mitochondrial disorders). Across all of these
diverse conditions with varying genetic causes (\textgreater8 genes),
these conditions converge on just 2 cell types: M2 macrophages and
epithelial cells.

Additional examples of therapeutics targets include; cardiac muscle and
endothelial cells in pheontypes associated with respiratory failure
(Supp. Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples-supp-rf}), microglia in frontal
lobe dementia (Supp. Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples-supp-dementia}),
chondrocytes in lethal skeletal dyplasia (Supp.
Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples-supp-lsd}), endothelial cells in small
vessel disease (Supp. Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples-supp-svd}),
oligodendrocytes and neurons in Parkinson's disease (Supp.
Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples-supp-pd}). and multiple gastrointestinal
and immune cell types in Alzheimer's disease (Supp.
Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples-supp-ad}). For further details please
refer to the Supplementary Results.

\subsubsection{Mappings}\label{mappings}

Mappings from HPO phenotypes and other commonly used medical ontologies
(SNOMED, UMLS, ICD-9, and ICD-10) were gathered using the Ontology Xref
Service (OxO; \url{https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/oxo/}) to facilitate
others using our results in future work. Direct mappings, with a
cross-ontology distance of 1, are the most precise and reliable. Counts
of mappings at each distance are shown in Table~\ref{tbl-mappings}. In
total, there were 15,105 direct mappings between the HPO and other
ontologies, with the largest number of mappings coming from the UMLS
ontology (12,898 UMLS terms).

\subsection{Discussion}\label{sec-discussion}

Investigating rare diseases (RDs) at the phenotype level offers
advantages in research and clinical medicine. Most RDs have a single
causal gene (7,671/8,631 = 89\%). Therefore aggregating genes into
phenotype-based sets enables well-powered analyses (mean
\textasciitilde{}\(76\) genes/phenotype). Phenotypes often converge on
shared molecular pathways, and a phenotype-centric approach captures
interindividual variation in disease presentations. This requires
mapping the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind each phenotype,
which we achieve here at phenome scale.

Across 201 cell types and 11,047 phenotypes, we found \textgreater46,514
significant phenotype--cell type relationships, enabling multi-scale
mechanistic tracing. Results replicate known links, add cellular
context, and uncover novel associations. Extensive benchmarking
confirmed expected associations, aided by comprehensive phenotype and
cell type ontologies. Key findings include enrichment of anatomically
matched associations, correlation of phenotype specificity with
association strength, precise subtypes for recurrent infections, and
links between congenital onset frequency and developmental cell types.

It is a matter of ongoing scientific debate as to whether the rare, more
monogenic versions of diseases and phenotypes share the same genetic
etiology as their common, polygenic counterparts\textsuperscript{52}.
Nevertheless, we identified several examples where these two disparate
data sources converge on the same cell types. These include the
implication of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in small vessel
disease\textsuperscript{55}, and the consistent association between
macrophages and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's\textsuperscript{53}. Additionally, we recover genome-wide
association study (GWAS) -derived associations between macular
degeneration and specific cell types of the eye (photoreceptor cells,
retinal pigment cells, Muller cells), immune system (dendritic cells,
macrophages), and vascular system (endothelial
cells)\textsuperscript{63}. A more systematic, phenome-wide comparison
of cell type association in rare vs.~common forms of diseases is
warranted, though remains outside the scope of our present study.

Despite our growing knowledge of RD genetics, less than 5\% of RDs have
treatments\textsuperscript{6}. However, advances in CRISPR, prime
editing, antisense oligonucleotides, viral/lipid
delivery\textsuperscript{64--67} are accelerating. The FDA's new
program\textsuperscript{68} aims to expand gene/cell therapy approvals
in years rather than decades\textsuperscript{69}, but success depends on
understanding the causal mechanisms of each RD. Here, we built a
reproducible pipeline for nominating cell type--resolved therapeutic
targets (Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples}), factoring in association
strength, gene specificity, severity, therapy delivery suitability, and
model translatability. We recovered \(87\)\% of active gene therapies,
confirming strong enrichment. Highlighted cases include
macrophage-driven phenotypes in Tay-Sachs, spinocerebellar ataxia, and
Alzheimer's disease, pinpointing specific phenotypes
(e.g.~neurofibrillary tangles) to causal cell types.

Current limitations of our study include missing certain rare cell
subtypes and states (e.g.~immune cell responses, diseased states, aging)
and incomplete knowledge of gene--phenotype associations. With the
expectation that data will continue to improve over time, our pipeline
is fully containerised and documented for end-to-end reproducibility.
Comprehensive, ontology-driven frameworks like ours enable discovery,
diagnosis, and basket trial design for shared molecular etiologies
across many diseases\textsuperscript{70}. Furthermore, we invite
collaborations to validate and translate these predictions, and have
publicly released all results via R packages and the Rare Disease
Celltyping Portal (\url{https://neurogenomics-ukdri.dsi.ic.ac.uk/}) to
support broad access for researchers, clinicians, and patients.

In summary, we present a scalable, cost-effective, and reproducible
method for phenome-wide, cell type--specific mechanism prediction in
RDs. With advances in gene therapy and supportive regulatory changes,
this approach can help realise the promise of genomic medicine for the
global RD community.

\subsection{Methods}\label{sec-methods}

\subsubsection{Human Phenotype Ontology}\label{human-phenotype-ontology}

The latest version of the HPO (release 2024-02-08) was downloaded from
the EMBL-EBI Ontology Lookup Service\textsuperscript{71} and imported
into R using the \texttt{HPOExplorer} package. This R object was used to
extract ontological relationships between phenotypes as well as to
assign absolute and relative ontological levels to each phenotype. The
latest version of the HPO phenotype-to-gene mappings and phenotype
annotations were downloaded from the official HPO GitHub repository and
imported into R using \texttt{HPOExplorer}. This contains lists of genes
associated with phenotypes via particular diseases, formatted as three
columns in a table (gene, phenotype, disease).

However, not all genes have equally strong evidence of causality with a
disease or phenotype, especially when considering that the variety of
resources used to generate these annotations (OMIM, Orphanet, DECIPHER)
use variable methodologies (e.g.~expert-curated review of the medical
literature vs.~automated text mining of the literature). Because of
this, formalizing phenotypes (or any biological entity) as unweighted
gene sets can lead to loss of information about the most relevant
signals. This is especially true when gene sets become large and poorly
supported, essentially decreasing the signal-to-noise
ratio\textsuperscript{74}.

Therefore we imported data from the Gene Curation Coalition
(GenCC)\textsuperscript{75,76}, which (as of 2025-08-02) 24,112 evidence
scores across 7,566 diseases and 5,533 genes. Evidence scores are
defined by GenCC using a standardised ordinal rubric which we then
encoded as a semi-quantitative score ranging from 0 (no evidence of
disease-gene relationship) to 6 (strongest evidence of disease-gene
relationship) (see Table~\ref{tbl-gencc}). As each Disease-Gene pair can
have multiple entries (from different studies) with different levels of
evidence, we then summed evidence scores per Disease-Gene pair to
generate aggregated Disease-by-Gene evidence scores. This procedure can
be described as follows.

Let us denote:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(D\) as diseases.
\item
  \(P\) as phenotypes in the HPO.
\item
  \(G\) as genes
\item
  \(S\) as the evidence scores describing the strength of the
  relationship between each Disease-Gene pair.
\item
  \(M_{ij}\) as the aggregated Disease-by-Gene evidence score matrix.
\end{itemize}

\[
M_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{\text{f}} D_i G_j S_k
\]

Next, we extracted Disease-Gene-Phenotype relationships from the
annotations file distributed by the HPO
(\emph{phenotype\_to\_genes.txt}). This provides a list of genes
associated with phenotypes via particular diseases, but does not include
any strength of evidence scores.

Here we define:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(A_{ijk}\) as the Disease-Gene-Phenotype relationships.
\item
  \(D_i\) as the \(i\)th disease.
\item
  \(G_j\) as the \(j\)th gene.
\item
  \(P_k\) as the \(k\)th phenotype.
\end{itemize}

\[
A_{ijk} = D_i G_j P_k
\]

In order to assign evidence scores to each Phenotype-Gene relationship,
we combined the aforementioned datasets from GenCC (\(M_{ij}\)) and HPO
(\(A_{ijk}\)) by merging on the gene and disease ID columns. For each
phenotype, we then computed the mean of Disease-Gene scores across all
diseases for which that phenotype is a symptom. This resulted in a final
2D tensor of Phenotype-by-Gene evidence scores (\(L_{ij}\)):

\hfill\break
\hfill\break

\[
 \eqnmarkbox[NavyBlue]{n1}{ L_{ij} } = 
 \begin{cases}
  \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{\text{f}}

\subsubsection{Single-cell transcriptomic
atlases}\label{single-cell-transcriptomic-atlases}

In this study, the gene by cell type specificity matrix was constructed
using the Descartes Human transcriptome atlas of foetal gene expression,
which contains a mixture of single-nucleus and single-cell RNA-seq data
(collected with sci-RNA-seq3)\textsuperscript{18}. This dataset contains
377,456 cells representing 77 distinct cell types across 15 tissues. All
121 human foetal samples ranged from 72 to 129 days in estimated
postconceptual age. To independently replicate our findings, we also
used the Human Cell Landscape which contains single-cell transcriptomic
data (collected with microwell-seq) from embryonic, foetal, and adult
human samples across 49 tissues\textsuperscript{19}.

Specificity matrices were generated separately for each transcriptomic
atlas using the R package \texttt{EWCE} (v1.11.3)\textsuperscript{77}.
Within each atlas, cell types were defined using the authors' original
freeform annotations in order to preserve the granularity of cell
subtypes as well as incorporate expert-identified rare cell types. Cell
types were only aligned and aggregated to the level of corresponding
Cell Ontology (CL)\textsuperscript{24} annotations afterwards when
generating summary figures and performing cross-atlas analyses. Using
the original gene-by-cell count matrices from each single-cell atlas, we
computed gene-by-cell type expression specificity matrices as follows.
Genes with very no expression across any cell types were considered to
be uninformative and were therefore removed from the input gene-by-cell
matrix \(F(g,i,c)\).

Next, we calculated the mean expression per cell type and normalised the
resulting matrix to transform it into a gene-by-cell type expression
specificity matrix (\(S_{g,c}\)). In other words, each gene in each cell
type had a 0-1 score where 1 indicated the gene was mostly specifically
expressed in that particular cell type relative to all other cell types.
This procedure was repeated separately for each of the single-cell
atlases and can be summarised as:

\subsubsection{Phenotype-cell type
associations}\label{phenotype-cell-type-associations-1}

To test for relationships between each pairwise combination of phenotype
(n=11,047) and cell type (n=201) we ran a series of univariate
generalised linear models implemented via the
\texttt{MSTExplorer::run\_phenomix} function in R (which uses
\texttt{stats::glm} internally). Framing association testing as a
regression problem rather than a gene set enrichment problem has
additional benefits, including speed. This allowed us to complete all
tests within \textasciitilde30 min on a MacBook Pro with 8 cores, while
early tests indicated that gene set enrichment-based methods like
\texttt{EWCE}\textsuperscript{78} would take days to weeks on a
high-performance computing cluster to complete the same number of tests
due to its computationally expensive bootstrapping procedure. These
tests also showed that \texttt{EWCE} was unable to recover nearly as
many true positive results (as indicated by our MKG benchmark) with a
comparable degree of precision (see related Issue for further details:
\url{https://github.com/neurogenomics/rare_disease_celltyping/issues/51}).

First, we filtered the gene-by-phenotype evidence score matrix
(\(L_{ij}\)) and the gene-by-cell type expression specificity matrix
(\(S_{gc}\)) to only include genes present in both matrices (n=4,949
genes in the Descartes Human analyses; n=4,653 genes in the Human Cell
Landscape analyses). Then, within each matrix any rows or columns with a
sum of 0 were removed as these were uninformative data points that did
not vary. To improve interpretability of the results \(\beta\)
coefficient estimates across models (i.e.~effect size), we performed a
scaling prestep on all dependent and independent variables. Initial
tests showed that this had virtually no impact on the total number of
significant results or any of the benchmarking metrics based on p-value
thresholds Fig.~\ref{fig-summary}. This scaling prestep improved our
ability to rank cell types by the strength of their association with a
given phenotype as determined by separate linear models.

We repeated the aforementioned procedure separately for each of the
single-cell references. Once all results were generated using both cell
type references (2,206,994 association tests total), we applied
Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate\textsuperscript{79} (denoted as
\(FDR_{pc}\)) to account for multiple testing. Of note, we applied this
correction across all results at once (as opposed to each single-cell
reference separately) to ensure the \(FDR_{pc}\) was stringently
controlled for across all tests performed in this study.

For the significant phenotype-cell type associations, we also wished to
identify which genes were most strongly driving this association. We
therefore designed a heuristic to consistently extract such \emph{driver
genes} . For a given phenotype-cell type pair, \emph{driver genes} were
defined as the intersect of genes that had a phenotype evidence score
\textgreater0 and were within the top 75th expression specificity
percentile (quantiles 30-40 out of 40) for the associated cell type.
This be described as follows.

Let

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(G\) be the full set of genes,
\item
  \(s_i\) be the phenotype evidence score for gene \(i\),
\item
  \(e_i\) be the expression specificity of gene \(i\) in the associated
  cell type,
\item
  \(q(e_i)\) be the empirical specificity percentile of \(e_i\) (ranging
  from 1 to 40).
\end{itemize}

We define two subsets: \[
A = \{\, i \in G : s_i > 0 \,\},
\] \[
B = \{\, i \in G : q(e_i) \ge 30 \,\}.
\]

The set of driver genes for that phenotype--cell type pair is then \[
D = A \cap B.
\]

In other words, \(D\) contains genes that both have nonzero phenotype
evidence and fall within the top \(75\%\) of expression specificity
(i.e.~quantiles \(30\)-\(40\) out of \(40\)) for the associated cell
type.

A programmatic implementation of this heuristic can be found in the
\texttt{MSTExplorer::add\_driver\_genes} R function.

\subsubsection{Symptom-cell type
associations}\label{symptom-cell-type-associations}

In the HPO, a phenotype can be associated with multiple diseases via
different subsets of genes (Supp. Fig.~\ref{fig-diagram}). Here we
define a symptom as a phenotype as it presents within the context of the
specific disease. A symptom's gene set is therefore the subset of genes
connecting a phenotype to a specific disease. For example, the phenotype
`Headache' (\emph{HP:0002315}) is associated with 346 genes across
different 192 diseases. Our association tests described above use
evidence scores from all 346 of these genes when testing for a
relationship between `Headache' and various cell types. However, the
disease `Erythrocytosis, familial, 1' (\emph{OMIM:133100}) is linked to
the `Headache' phenotype via a single gene; \emph{EPOR}. Thus, the
symptom `Heachache due to Erythrocytosis, familial, 1' would have only
\emph{EPOR} as its gene list. Another disease, `Migraine with or without
aura, susceptibility to, 1' (\emph{OMIM:157300}) is linked with
`Headache' via 3 different genes (\emph{ESR1}, \emph{TNF},
\emph{EDNRA}), so the symptom `Heachache' in the presence of this
disease would consist of these 3 genes.

More formally, the features of a given symptom can be described as the
subset of genes annotated to phenotype \(p\) via a particular disease
\(d\), denoted as \(G_{dp}\) (see Fig.~\ref{fig-diagram}). We then
computed the intersect between symptom genes (\(G_{dp}\)) and driver
genes (described in the previous section, and denoted as \(G_{pc}\)),
resulting in the gene subset \(G_{d \cap p \cap c}\). Only
\(G_{d \cap p \cap c}\) gene sets with 25\% or greater overlap with the
symptom gene subset (\(G_{dp}\)) were kept. This procedure was repeated
for all phenotype-cell type-disease triads, which can be summarised as
follows:

\hfill\break

\begin{equation*}
  \frac{
     \eqnmarkbox[Chartreuse3]{g1}{|G_{d \cap p \cap c} |}
    }{
       \eqnmarkbox[Emerald]{g2}{|G_{dp}|}} 
  \geq \eqnmarkbox[SeaGreen]{g3}{.25}

\hfill\break
\hfill\break

\subsubsection{Validation of expected phenotype-cell type
relationships}\label{validation-of-expected-phenotype-cell-type-relationships-1}

We first sought to confirm that our tests (across both single-cell
references) were able to recover expected phenotype-cell type
relationships across seven high-level branches within the HPO
(Fig.~\ref{fig-summary}), including abnormalities of the cardiovascular
system, endocrine system, eye, immune system, musculoskeletal system,
nervous system, and respiratory system. Within each branch the number of
significant tests in a given cell type were plotted
(Fig.~\ref{fig-summary}b). Mappings between freeform annotations (the
level at which we performed our phenotype- cell type association tests)
provided by the original atlas authors and their closest CL term
equivalents were provided by CellxGene\textsuperscript{36}. CL terms
along the \emph{x-axis} of Fig.~\ref{fig-summary}b were assigned colours
corresponding to which HPO branch showed the greatest number of
enrichments (after normalising within each branch to account for
differences in scale). The normalised colouring allows readers to
quickly assess which HPO branch was most often associated with each cell
type, while accounting for differences in the number of phenotypes
across branches. We then ran a series of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
tests to determine whether (within a given branch) a given cell type was
more often enriched (FDR\textless0.05) within that branch relative to
all of the other HPO branches of an equivalent level in the ontology
(including all branches not shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-summary}b). After
applying Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing
correction\textsuperscript{79} (denoted as \(FDR _{b,c}\)), we annotated
each respective branch-by-cell type bar according to the significance
(**** : \(FDR _{b,c}<1e-04\), *** : \(FDR _{b,c}<0.001\), ** :
\(FDR _{b,c}<0.01\), * : \(FDR _{b,c}<0.05\)). Cell types in
Fig.~\ref{fig-summary}a-b were ordered along the \emph{x-axis} according
to a dendrogram derived from the CL ontology (Fig.~\ref{fig-summary}c),
which provides ground-truth semantic relationships between all cell
types (e.g.~different neuronal subtypes are grouped together).

As an additional measure of the accuracy of our phenotype-cell types
test results we identified conceptually matched branches across the HPO
and the CL (Fig.~\ref{fig-summary}d and Table~\ref{tbl-celltypes}). For
example, `Abnormality of the cardiovascular system' in the HPO was
matched with `cardiocytes' in the CL which includes all cell types
specific to the heart. Analogously, `Abnormality of the nervous system'
in the HPO was matched with `neural cell' in the CL which includes all
descendant subtypes of neurons and glia. This cross-ontology matching
was repeated for each HPO branch and can be referred to as on-target
cell types. Within each branch, the \(-log_{10}(FDR _{pc})\) values of
on-target cell types were binned by rounding to the nearest integer
(\emph{x-axis}) and the percentage of tests for on-target cell types
relative to all cell types were computed at each bin (\emph{y-axis})
(Fig.~\ref{fig-summary}d). The baseline level (dotted horizontal line)
illustrates the percentage of on-target cell types relative to the total
number of observed cell types. Any percentages above this baseline level
represent greater than chance representation of the on-target cell types
in the significant tests.

\subsubsection{Validation of inter- and intra-dataset
consistency}\label{validation-of-inter--and-intra-dataset-consistency-1}

We tested for inter-dataset consistency of our phenotype-cell type
association results across different single-cell reference datasets
(Descartes Human and Human Cell Landscape). For association tests with
exactly matching Cell Ontology ID across the two references, we tested
for a relationship between the effect sizes (each GLM model's \(R^2\)
estimates) generated with each of the references by fitting linear
regression model (\texttt{stats::lm} via the R function
\texttt{ggstatsplot::ggscatterstats}). We repeated this regression
analysis using only the phenotype-cell type associations that were
significant (FDR \textless{} 0.05) in both reference datasets.

We also tested for intra-dataset consistency within the Human Cell
Landscape by running additional linear regressions between the
phenotype-cell type association test statistics of the foetal and the
adult samples (again using estimates from all results, and
significant-only results). While we would not expect the same exact cell
type associations across different developmental stages, we would
nevertheless expect there to be some degree of correlation between the
developing and mature versions of the same cell types.

Finally, we compute the symmetric replication rate within each of the
comparison described above (between scRNA-seq references, and between
developmental stages within the Human Cell Landscape). This was defined
as the proportion of significant results (FDR \textless{} 0.05) in
dataset A that were also significant (FDR \textless{} 0.05) in dataset
B, and vice versa, averaged across both directions. This can be
described as follows.

\textbf{Variable descriptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(S_{A}\): The set of phenotype--cell-type associations that pass the
  significance threshold (e.g., \(FDR < 0.05\)) in dataset \(A\).
\item
  \(S_{B}\): The set of phenotype--cell-type associations that pass the
  same significance threshold in dataset \(B\).
\item
  \(S_{A} \cap S_{B}\): The set of associations that are significant in
  \emph{both} datasets.
\item
  \(RR\): Replication rate.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Directional replication rate (A → B)}

\[ 
\text{RR}_{A \rightarrow B}
=
\frac{
\left| 
S_{A} \cap S_{B}
\right|
}{
\left|
S_{A}
\right|
}
\]

\textbf{Directional replication rate (B → A)}

\[
\text{RR}_{B \rightarrow A}
=
\frac{
\left| 
S_{A} \cap S_{B}
\right|
}{
\left|
S_{B}
\right|
}
\]

\textbf{Symmetric replication rate}

\[
RR_{sym} 
=
\frac{
\left(
        RR_{A \rightarrow B}
        +
            RR_{B \rightarrow A}
        \right)
}{2}
\]

\subsubsection{More specific phenotypes are associated with fewer genes
and cell
types}\label{more-specific-phenotypes-are-associated-with-fewer-genes-and-cell-types-1}

To explore the relationship between HPO phenotype specificity and
various metrics from our results, we computed the information content
(IC) scores for each term in the HPO. IC is a measure of how much
specific information a term within an ontology contains. In general,
terms deeper in an ontology (closer to the leaves) are more specific,
and thus informative, than terms at the very root of the ontology
(e.g.~`Phenotypic abnormality'). Where \(k\) denotes the number of
offspring terms (including the term itself) and \(N\) denotes the total
number of terms in the ontology, IC can be calculated as:

\[
IC=-log(\frac{k}{N})
\]

Next, IC scores were quantised into 10 bins using the \texttt{ceiling} R
function to improve visualisation. We then performed a series of linear
regressions between phenotype binned IC scores and: 1) number of genes
annotated per HPO phenotype, 2) the number of significantly associated
cell types per HPO phenotype, and 3) the model estimate of each
significant phenotype-cell type associations (at FDR \textless{} 0.05)
after taking the log of the absolute value (\(log_2(|estimate|)\)).

\subsubsection{Monarch Knowledge Graph
recall}\label{monarch-knowledge-graph-recall}

Finally, we gathered known phenotype-cell type relationships from the
Monarch Knowledge Graph (MKG), a comprehensive database of links between
many aspects of disease biology\textsuperscript{25}. This currently
includes 103 links between HPO phenotypes (n=103) and CL cell types
(n=79). Of these, we only considered the 82 phenotypes that we were able
to test given that our ability to generate associations was dependent on
the existence of gene annotations within the HPO. We considered
instances where we found a significant relationship between exactly
matching pairs of HPO-CL terms as a hit.

However, as the cell types in MKG were not necessarily annotated at the
same level as our single-cell references, we considered instances where
the MKG cell type was an ancestor term of our cell type (e.g.~`myeloid
cell' vs.~`monocyte'), or \emph{vice versa}, as hits. We also adjusted
ontological distance by computing the ratio between the observed
ontological distance and the smallest possible ontological distance for
that cell type given the cell type that were available in our references
(\(dist_{adjusted}=(\frac{dist_{observed}+1}{dist_{minimum}+1})-1\)).
This provides a way of accurately measuring how dissimilar our
identified cell types were for each phenotype-cell type association
(Fig.~\ref{fig-monarch-recall}).

\subsubsection{Prioritising phenotypes based on
severity}\label{prioritising-phenotypes-based-on-severity-1}

Only a small fraction of the the phenotypes in HPO (\textless1\%) have
metadata annotations containing information on their time course,
consequences, and severity. This is due to the time-consuming nature of
manually annotating thousands of phenotypes. To generate such
annotations at scale, we previously used Generative Pre-trained
Transformer 4 (GPT-4), a large language model (LLM) as implemented
within OpenAI's Application Programming Interface
(API)\textsuperscript{22}. After extensive prompt engineering and
ground-truth benchmarking, we were able to acquire annotations on how
often each phenotype directly causes intellectual disability, death,
impaired mobility, physical malformations, blindness, sensory
impairments, immunodeficiency, cancer, reduced fertility, or is
associated with a congenital onset. These criteria were previously
defined in surveys of medical experts as a means of systematically
assessing phenotype severity\textsuperscript{80}. Responses for each
metric were provided in a consistent one-word format which could be one
of: `never', `rarely', `often', `always'. This procedure was repeated in
batches (to avoid exceeding token limits) until annotations were
gathered for 16,982/18,082 HPO phenotypes.

We then encoded these responses into a semi-quantitative scoring system
(`never'=0, `rarely'=1, `often'=2, `always'=3), which were then weighted
by multiplying a semi-subjective scoring of the relevance of each metric
to the concept of severity on a scale from \(1.0\)-\(6.0\), with \(6.0\)
being the most severe (`death'=6, `intellectual\_disability'=5,
`impaired\_mobility'=4, `physical\_malformations'=3, `blindness'=4,
`sensory\_impairments'=3, `immunodeficiency'=3, `cancer'=3,
`reduced\_fertility'=1, `congenital\_onset'=1). Finally, the product of
the score was normalised to a quantitative severity score ranging from
0-100, where 100 is the theoretical maximum severity score. This
phenotype severity scoring procedure can be expressed as follows.

Let us denote:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(p\) : a phenotype in the HPO.
\item
  \(j\) : the identity of a given annotation metric (i.e.~clinical
  characteristic, such as `intellectual disability' or `congenital
  onset').
\item
  \(W_j\): the assigned weight of metric \(j\).
\item
  \(F_j\): the maximum possible value for metric \(j\), equal to 3
  (``always''). This value is equivalent across all \(j\) annotations.
\item
  \(F_{pj}\) : the numerically encoded value of annotation metric \(j\)
  for phenotype \(p\).
\item
  \(NSS_p\): the final composite severity score for phenotype \(p\)
  after applying normalisation to align values to a 0-100 scale and
  ensure equivalent meaning regardless of which other phenotypes are
  being analysed in addition to \(p\). This allows for direct
  comparability of severity scores across studies with different sets of
  phenotypes.

Using the numerically encoded GPT annotations (0=``never'',
1=``rarely'', 2=``often'', 3=``always'') we computed the mean encoded
value per cell type within each annotation. One-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum
tests were run using the \texttt{rstatix::wilcox\_test()} function to
test whether each cell type was associated with more severe phenotypes
relative to all other cell types. This procedure was repeated for
severity annotation independently (death, intellectual disability,
impaired mobility, etc.) Fig.~\ref{fig-celltype-severity-dot}a. Next, we
performed a Pearson correlation test between the number of phenotypes
that a cell type is significantly associated with (at FDR\textless0.05)
has a relationship with the mean composite GPT severity score of those
phenotypes (Fig.~\ref{fig-celltype-severity-dot}b). This was performed
using the \texttt{ggstatsplot::ggscatterstats()} R function.

\subsubsection{Congenital phenotypes are associated with foetal cell
types}\label{congenital-phenotypes-are-associated-with-foetal-cell-types-1}

The GPT-4 annotations also enabled us to assess whether foetal cell
types were more often significantly associated with congenital
phenotypes in our Human Cell Landscape results as this single-cell
reference contained both adult and foetal versions of cell types
(Fig.~\ref{fig-congenital}). To do this, we performed a chi-squared
(\(\chi^2\)) test on the proportion of significantly associated cell
types containing any of the substrings or (within cell types annotations
from the original Human Cell Landscape authors\textsuperscript{19})
vs.~those associated without, stratified by how often the corresponding
phenotype had a congenital onset according to the GPT phenotype
annotations (including `never', `rarely', `often', `always'). In
addition, a series of \(\chi^2\) tests were performed within each
congenital onset frequency strata, to determine whether the observed
proportion of foetal cell types vs.~non-foetal cell types significantly
deviated from the proportions expected by chance.

We next tested whether the proportion of tests with significant
associations with foetal cell types varied across the major HPO branches
using a \(\chi^2\) test. We also performed separate \(\chi^2\) test
within each branch to determine whether the proportion of significant
associations with foetal cell types was significantly different from
chance.

Next, we aimed to create a continuous metric from -1 to 1 that indicated
how biased each phenotype is towards associations with the foetal or
adult form of a cell type. For each phenotype we calculated the
foetal-adult bias score as the difference in the association p-values
between the foetal and adult version of the equivalent cell type
(\(\text{foetal-adult bias}: p_{adult} - p_{foetal} = \Delta p \in [-1,1]\)).
A score of 1 indicates the phenotype is only associated with the foetal
version of the cell type and -1 indicates the phenotype is only
associated with the adult version of the cell type.

In order to summarise higher-order HPO phenotype categories that were
most biased towards foetal or adult cell types, ontological enrichment
tests were run on the phenotypes with the top/bottom 50
greatest/smallest foetal-adult bias scores. The enrichment tests were
performed using the \texttt{simona::dag\_enrich\_on\_offsprings}
function, which uses a hypergeometric test to determine whether a list
of terms in an ontology are enriched for offspring terms (descendants)
of a given ancestor term within the ontology. Phenotypes categories with
an HPO ontological enrichment a p-value \textless{} 0.05 were considered
significant.

We were similarly interested in which higher-order cell type categories
tended to be most commonly associated with these strongly
foetal-/adult-biased phenotype s. Another set of ontological enrichment
tests were run on the cell types associated with the top/bottom 50
phenotypes from the previous analysis. The CL ontology-aligned IDs for
each group cell types were fed into the
\texttt{simona::dag\_enrich\_on\_offsprings} using the CL ontology.
Significiantly enriched cell type categories were defined as those with
a CL ontological enrichment p-value \textless{} 0.05.

\subsubsection{Therapeutic target
identification}\label{therapeutic-target-identification-1}

We developed a systematic and automated strategy for identifying
putative cell type-specific gene targets for each phenotype based on a
series of filters at phenotype, cell type, and gene levels.

First, we transformed our phenotype-cell type association results and
merged them with primary data sources (e.g.~GenCC gene-disease
relationships, scRNA-seq atlas datasets) to create a large table of
multi-scale relationships, where each row represented a tetrad of
disease-phenotype-cell type-gene relationships. We then filtered
non-significant phenotype-cell type relationships (only associations
with \(FDR<0.05\)) as well as phenotype-gene relationships with strong
causal evidence (\(\text{GenCC score}>3\)). We also removed any
phenotypes that were too broad to be clinically useful, as quantified
using the information content (IC) (\(IC>8\)), which measures the how
specific each term is within an ontology (i.e.~HPO). Gene-cell type
relationships were established by taking genes that had the top 25\%
expression specificity quantiles within each cell type. When connecting
cell types to diseases via phenotypes, we used a symptom intersection
threshold of \textgreater.25. Next, we sorted the remaining results in
descending order of phenotype severity using the GPT4 composite severity
scores described earlier. Finally, to limit the size of the resulting
multi-scale networks we took only the top 10 rows, where each row
represented a tetrad of disease-phenotype-cell type-gene relationships.
This resulted in number of relatively small, high-confidence
disease-phenotype-cell type-gene networks that could be reasonably
interrogated through manual inspection and network visualisation. For
example, if one was interested in the mechanisms causing `Recurrent
Neisserial infections', one would need only select all rows that include
this phenotype to find all of its most relevant connection to diseases,
cell types, and genes.

The entire target prioritisation procedure can be replicated with a
single function: \texttt{MSTExplorer::prioritise\_targets}. This
function automates all of the reference data gathering (e.g.~phenotype
metadata, cell type metadata, cell type signature reference, gene
lengths, severity tiers) and takes a variety of arguments at each step
for greater customisability. Each step is described in detail in
Table~\ref{tbl-filters}. Phenotypes that often or always caused physical
malformations (according to the GPT-4 annotations) were also removed
from the final prioritised targets list, as these were unlikely to be
amenable to gene therapy interventions. Finally, phenotypes were sorted
by their composite severity scores such that the most severe phenotypes
were ranked the highest.

\subsubsection{Therapeutic target
validation}\label{therapeutic-target-validation-1}

To assess whether our prioritised therapeutic targets were likely to be
viable, we computed the overlap between our gene targets and those of
existing gene therapies at various stages of clinical development
(Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-validate}). Gene targets were obtained for each
therapy from the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD; release 2025-11-18)
and mapped onto standardised HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)
gene symbols using the \texttt{orthogene} R package. We stratified our
overlap metrics according to whether the therapies had failed
(unsuccessful clinical trials or withdrawn), or were non-failed
(successful or ongoing clinical trials). We then conducted
hypergeometric tests to determine whether the observed overlap between
our prioritised targets and the non-failed therapy targets was
significantly greater than expected by chance (i.e.~enrichment). We also
conducted a second hypergeometric test to determine whether the observed
overlap between our prioritised targets and the failed therapy targets
was significantly less than expected by chance (i.e.~depletion).
Finally, we repeated the analysis against all therapeutic targets, not
just those of gene therapies, to determine whether our prioritised
targets had relevance to other therapeutic modalities.

\subsubsection{Experimental model
translatability}\label{experimental-model-translatability}

To improve the likelihood of successful translation between preclinical
animal models and human patients, we created an interspecies
translatability prediction tool for each phenotype nominated by our gene
therapy prioritised pipeline (Supp. Fig.~\ref{fig-animal-models}).
First, we extracted ontological similarity scores of homologous
phenotypes across species from the MKG\textsuperscript{25}. Briefly, the
ontological similarity scores (\(SIM_o\)) are computed for each
homologous pair of phenotypes across two ontologies by calculating the
overlap in homologous phenotypes that are ancestors or descendants of
the target phenotype. Next, we generated genotypic similarity scores
(\(SIM_g\)) for each homologous phenotype pair by computing the
proportion of 1:1 orthologous genes using gene annotation from their
respective ontologies. Interspecies orthologs were also obtained from
the MKG. Finally, both scores are multiplied together to yield a unified
ontological-genotypic similarity score (\(SIM_{og}\)).

\subsubsection{Novel R packages}\label{novel-r-packages}

To facilitate all analyses described in this study and to make them more
easily reproducible by others, we created several open-source R
packages.
\href{https://github.com/neurogenomics/KGExplorer}{\texttt{KGExplorer}}
imports and analyses large-scale biomedical knowledge graphs and
ontologies.
\href{https://github.com/neurogenomics/HPOExplorer}{\texttt{HPOExplorer}}
aids in managing and querying the directed acyclic ontology graph within
the HPO.
\href{https://github.com/neurogenomics/MSTExplorer}{\texttt{MSTExplorer}}
facilitates the efficient analysis of many thousands of phenotype-cell
type association tests, and provides a suite of multi-scale therapeutic
target prioritisation and visualisation functions. These R packages also
include various functions for distributing the post-processed results
from this study in an organised, tabular format. Of note,
\texttt{MSTExplorer::load\_example\_results} loads all summary
statistics from our phenotype-cell type tests performed here.

\subsubsection{Rare Disease Celltyping
Portal}\label{rare-disease-celltyping-portal}

To further increase the ease of access for stakeholders in the RD
community without the need for programmatic experience, we developed a
series of web apps to interactively explore, visualise, and download the
results from our study. Collectively, these web apps are called the Rare
Disease Celltyping Portal. The website can be accessed at
\url{https://neurogenomics-ukdri.dsi.ic.ac.uk/}.

The Rare Disease Celltyping Portal integrates diverse datasets,
including the HPO, cell types, genes, and phenotype severity, into a
unified platform that allows users to perform flexible, bidirectional
queries. Users can start from any entry point: either phenotype, cell
type, genes, or severity, and seamlessly trace relationships across
these dimensions.

The portal provides a dynamic and intuitive exploration experience with
its real-time interaction capabilities and responsive interface
including network graphs, bar charts, and heat maps. It has the ability
to handle large datasets efficiently and offer fast query response by
building with FARM stack (FastAPI, React, MongoDB). The portal is
designed for a broad audience, including researchers, clinicians, and
biologists, by offering user-friendly navigation and interactive visual
outputs. By enabling users to intuitively explore complex biological
relationships, the portal aims to accelerate rare disease research,
enhance diagnostic accuracy, and drive therapeutic innovation.

All code used to generate the website can be found at
\url{https://github.com/neurogenomics/Rare-Disease-Web-Portal}.

\subsubsection{Mappings}\label{mappings-1}

Mappings from the HPO to other medical ontologies were extracted from
the EMBL-EBI Ontology Xref Service (OxO;
\url{https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/oxo/}) by selecting the National Cancer
Institute metathesaurus (NCIm) as the target ontology and either
``SNOMED CT'', ``UMLS'', ``ICD-9'' or ``ICD-10CM'' as the data source.
HPO terms were then selected as the ID framework with to mediate the
cross-ontology mappings. Mappings between each pair of ontologies were
then downloaded, stored in a tabular format. The mappings files can be
accessed with the function \texttt{HPOExplorer::get\_mappings} or
directly via the \texttt{HPOExplorer} Releases page on GitHub
(\url{https://github.com/neurogenomics/HPOExplorer/releases/tag/latest}).

\subsection{Supplementary Materials}\label{supplementary-materials}

\subsubsection{Supplementary Results}\label{supplementary-results}

\paragraph{Congenital phenotypes are associated with foetal cell
types}\label{congenital-phenotypes-are-associated-with-foetal-cell-types-2}

To test whether some cell types tend to show strong differences in their
phenotype associations between their foetal and adult forms. To test
this, we performed an analogous enrichment procedure as with the
phenotypes, except using Cell Ontology terms and the Cell Ontology
graph. This analysis identified the cell type category connective tissue
cell (\(p=\)\(1.8 \times 10^{-3}\),
\(log_2(\text{fold-change})\)=\(3.2\)) as the most foetal-biased cell
type. No cell type categories were significantly enriched for the most
adult-biased cell types. This is likely due to the fact that cell types
can be disrupted at different stages of life, resulting in different
phenotypes. Thus there the same cell types may be involved in both the
most foetal-biased and adult-biased phenotypes.

\paragraph{Selected example targets}\label{selected-example-targets-1}

From our prioritised targets, we selected the following four sets of
phenotypes or diseases as examples: `GM2-ganglioside accumulation',
`Spinocerebellar atrophy', `Neuronal loss in central nervous system'.
Only phenotypes with a GPT severity score greater than \(15\) were
considered to avoid overplotting and to focus on the more clinically
relevant phenotypes Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples}a-h. These examples
were then selected partly on the basis of severity rankings, and partly
for their relatively smaller, simpler networks than lent themselves to
compact visualisations.

Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a devastating hereditary condition in which
children are born appearing healthy, which gradually degrades leading to
death after 3-5 years. The underlying cause is the toxic accumulation of
gangliosides in the nervous system due to a loss of the enzyme produced
by \emph{HEXA}. While this could in theory be corrected with gene
editing technologies, there remain some outstanding challenges. One of
which is identifying which cell types should be targeted to ensure the
most effective treatments. Here we identified alternatively activated
macrophages as the cell type most strongly associated with
`GM2-ganglioside accumulation' Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples}i. The
role of aberrant macrophage activity in the regulation of ganglioside
levels is supported by observation that gangliosides accumulate within
macrophages in TSD\textsuperscript{44}, as well as experimental evidence
in rodent models\textsuperscript{45.,46,47}. Our results not only
corroborate these findings, but propose macrophages as the primary
causal cell type in TSD, making it the most promising cell type to
target in therapies.

Another challenge in TSD is early detection and diagnosis, before
irreversible damage has occurred. Our pipeline implicated extravillous
trophoblasts of the placenta in `GM2-ganglioside accumulation'. While
not necessarily a target for gene therapy (as the child is detached from
the placenta after birth), checking these cells \emph{in utero} for an
absence of \emph{HEXA} may serve as a viable biomarker as these cells
normally express the gene at high levels. Early detection of TSD may
lengthen the window of opportunity for therapeutic
intervention\textsuperscript{81}, especially when genetic sequencing is
not available or variants of unknown significance are found within
\emph{HEXA}\textsuperscript{82}.

Spinocerebellar atrophy is a debilitating and lethal phenotype that
occurs in diseases such as Spinocerebellar ataxia and Boucher-Nenhauser
syndrome. These diseases are characterised by progressive degeneration
of the cerebellum and spinal cord, leading to severe motor and cognitive
impairments. Our pipeline identified M2 macrophages (labeled as the
closest CL term `Alternatively activated macrophages' in
Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples}j) as the only causal cell type
associated with `Spinocerebellar atrophy'. This strongly suggests that
degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells are in fact downstream
consequences of macrophage dysfunction, rather than being the primary
cause themselves. This is consistent with the known role of macrophages,
especially microglia, in neuroinflammation and other neurodegenerative
conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinsons'
disease\textsuperscript{48--50}. While experimental and postmortem
observational studies have implicated microglia in spinocerebellar
atrophy previously\textsuperscript{48}, our results provide a
statistically-supported and unbiased genetic link between known risk
genes and this cell type. Therefore, targeting M2 microglia in the
treatment of spinocerebellar atrophy may therefore represent a promising
therapeutic strategy. This is aided by the fact that there are mouse
models that perturb the ortholog of human spinocerebellar atrophy risk
genes
(e.g.~\href{https://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:104783}{\emph{Atxn1}},
\href{https://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:1354723}{\emph{Pnpla6}})
and reliably recapitulate the effects of this diseases at the cellular
(e.g.~loss of Purkinje cells), morphological (e.g.~atrophy of the
cerebellum, spinal cord, and muscles), and functional (e.g.~ataxia)
levels.

Next, we investigated the phenotype `Neuronal loss in the central
nervous system'. Despite the fact that this is a fairly broad phenotype,
we found that it was only significantly associated with 3 cell types
(alternatively activated macrophage, macrophage, epithelial cell),
specifically M2 macrophages and sinusoidal endothelial cells
Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples}k.

Skeletal dysplasia is a heterogeneous group of over 450 disorders that
affect the growth and development of bone and cartilage. This phenotype
can be lethal when deficient bone growth leads to the constriction of
vital organs such as the lungs. Even after surgical interventions, these
complications continue to arise as the child develops. Pharmacological
interventions to treat this condition have largely been ineffective.
While there are various cell types involved in skeletal system
development, our pipeline nominated chondrocytes as the causal cell type
underlying the lethal form of this condition
(Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples-supp}). Assuringly, we found that the
disease `Achondrogenesis Type 1B' is caused by the genes \emph{SLC26A2}
and \emph{COL2A1} via chondrocytes. We also found that `Platyspondylic
lethal skeletal dysplasia, Torrance type'. Thus, in cases where surgical
intervention is insufficient, targeting these genes within chondrocytes
may prove a viable long-term solution for children suffering from lethal
skeletal dysplasia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative condition.
It is characterised by a set of variably penetrant phenotypes including
memory loss, cognitive decline, and cerebral proteinopathy.
Interestingly, we found that different forms of early onset AD (which
are defined by the presence of a specific disease gene) are each
associated with different cell types via different phenotypes
(Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples-supp}). For example, AD 3 and AD 4 are
primarily associated with cells of the digestive system (`enterocyte',
`gastric goblet cell') and are implied to be responsible for the
phenotypes `Senile plaques', `Alzheimer disease', `Parietal
hypometabolism in FDG PET'. Meanwhile, AD 2 is primarily associated with
immune cells (`alternatively activated macrophage') and is implied to be
responsible for the phenotypes `Neurofibrillary tangles', `Long-tract
signs'. This suggests that different forms of AD may be driven by
different cell types and phenotypes, which may help to explain its
variability in onset and clinical presentation.

Finally, Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by motor symptoms
such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However there are a number
of additional phenotypes associated with the disease that span multiple
physiological systems. PD 19a and PD 8 seemed to align most closely with
the canonical understanding of PD as a disease of the central nervous
system in that they implicated oligodendrocytes and neurons
(Fig.~\ref{fig-therapy-examples-supp}). Though the reference datasets
being used in this study were not annotated at sufficient resolution to
distinguish between different subtypes of neurons, in particular
dopaminergic neurons. PD 19a/8 also suggested that risk variants in
\emph{LRRK2} mediate their effects on PD through both myeloid cells and
oligodendrocytes by causing gliosis of the substantia nigra. The
remaining clusters of PD mechanisms revolved around chondrocytes (PD
20), amacrine cells of the eye (hereditary late-onset PD), and the
respiratory/immune system (PD 14). While the diversity in cell
type-specific mechanisms is somewhat surprising, it may help to explain
the wide variety of cross-system phenotypes frequently observed in PD.

It should be noted that the HPO only includes gene annotations for the
monogenic forms of AD and PD. However it has previously been shown that
there is at least partial overlap in their phenotypic and genetic
etiology with respect to their common forms. Thus understanding the
monogenic forms of these diseases may shed light onto their more common
counterparts.

\subsubsection{Experimental model
translatability}\label{experimental-model-translatability-1}

We computed interspecies translatability scores using a combination of
both ontological (\(SIM_{o}\)) and genotypic (\(SIM_{g}\)) similarity
relative to each homologous human phenotype and its associated genes
Supp. Fig.~\ref{fig-animal-models}. In total, we mapped 1,221 non-human
phenotypes (in \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}, \emph{Danio rerio},
\emph{Mus musculus}, \emph{Rattus norvegicus}) to 3,319 homologous human
phenotypes. Amongst the 5,252 phenotype within our prioritised therapy
targets, 1,788 had viable animal models in at least on non-human
species. Per species, the number of homologous phenotypes was: \emph{Mus
musculus} (n=1705), \emph{Danio rerio} (n=244), \emph{Rattus norvegicus}
(n=85), \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} (n=23). Amongst our prioritised
targets with a GPT-4 severity score of \textgreater10, the phenotypes
with the greatest animal model similarity were ``Rudimentary to absent
tibiae'' (\(SIM_{og}=1\)), ``Hypoglutaminemia'' (\(SIM_{og}=1\)),
``Bilateral ulnar hypoplasia'' (\(SIM_{og}=0.99\)), ``Disproportionate
shortening of the tibia'' (\(SIM_{og}=0.99\)), ``Acrobrachycephaly''
(\(SIM_{og}=0.98\)).

network of recurrent Neisserial infections (RNI) reveals multi-scale
disease etiology.} RNI is a phenotype in seven different monogenic
diseases caused by disruptions to specific complement system genes. Four
cell types were significantly associated with RNI. \textbf{a}, One can
trace how genes causal for RNI (yellow boxes, bottom) mediate their
effects through cell types (orange circles, middle) and diseases (blue
cylinders, top). Cell types are connected to RNI via association testing
(FDR\textless0.05). Genes shown here have both strong evidence for a
causal role in RNI and high expression specificity in the associated
cell type. Cell types can be linked to monogenic diseases via the genes
specifically expressed in those cell types (i.e.~are in the top 25\% of
cell type specificity expression quantiles). Nodes are arranged using
the Sugiyama algorithm\textsuperscript{83}. \textbf{b} Expression
specificity quantiles (1-40 scale) of each driver gene in each cell type
(darker = greater specificity). \textbf{c} GenCC-derived eevidence
scores between the RNI phenotype and each gene. \textbf{d} Expression
specificity (0 = least specific, 1 = most specific) of each gene in each
