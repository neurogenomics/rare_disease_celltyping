## Introduction
Rare diseases (RDs) are uncommon as individual diagnoses, but as a group contribute to an enormous disease burden globally. However, partly due the low prevalence and high diversity of individual RDs, this category of diseases is understudied and under-resourced. The advent of large, standardised genetics databases has enabled high-throughput, comprehensive approaches that uncover new insights into the multi-scale aetiology of thousands of diseases. Here, using the Human Phenotype Ontology (9,677 annotated phenotypes) and multiple single-cell transcriptomic atlases (77 human cell types and 38 mouse cell types), we conducted >688,000 enrichment tests (x100,000 bootstrap iterations each) to identify >13,888 genetically supported cell type-phenotype associations.
