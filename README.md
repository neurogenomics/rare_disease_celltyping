  - Code for generating the CTD files is stored within CTD_code
  - The actual CTD files are in the lab dropbox
  - Around 31st October 2017, I wrote a script ([process_hpo_to_genelists.r] which read in [TermsToUse.csv], which contained a list of brain relevant traits, and extracted those gene sets. At some point, I then modified this file to create [process_hpo_to_genelists-wholebody.r]. This no longer limited itself to brain relevant traits. It saved all the gene lists to the [GeneLists-WholeBody] folder which is also included in the repo.
